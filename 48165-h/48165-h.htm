<small>THE GRAND PRINCIPALITY—VLADIMIR MONOMAKH.</small></h3>

<p>One of the illustrious successors of Iaroslaf the Great upon
the throne of Kief, was his grandson Vladimir, grandson
also of the Greek emperor Constantine Monomachus, whose
surname he bore;<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> a man of wisdom, of valor, and of integrity—a
singular instance of elevation of character in an
age and among a people but partly emerged from barbarism.
He waited long for his right to rule, having respect to the
national law that gave precedence to the oldest member of
the deceased sovereign’s family. “His father was older than
mine, and reigned first in Kief,” he said, deferring to his
cousin Sviatopolk Isiaslavitch.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> Certain of Monomakh’s
kinsmen had been wrongfully deprived of their lands by
Vsevolod and Isiaslaf, respectively father and uncle of Monomakh.
The latter accepted Tchernigof as his share of the
spoil; for beyond the right of the strongest, no right was
seriously considered in the Russia of that age. Oleg, one of
the injured princes, called the Polovtsui barbarians to his
aid, and harried the lands of those who had robbed him.
Monomakh, moved by the distress of the people, offered to
restore the wrested lands that had fallen to his share. To
his efforts was due the assembling of the more powerful
princes in Congress at Lübetch (1090), on the Dnieper, to
effect means for the suppression of the civil wars that afflicted
the realm. Seated on a carpet, the princes drew up
a treaty, each prince taking oath and kissing the cross, as
he declared that thereafter “the Russian land shall be held
sacred and dear, as the country of us all. Whoso shall dare
to arm himself against his brother, becomes our common
enemy.” As nearly as is known, this treaty is the first
written assertion of the unity that was incipient in the administration
of Ruric, that took form and strength from the
administrations of Vladimir and Iaroslaf, and that has been
steadily developing through a thousand years of national
existence: a unity that holds in an apparently inviolable
bond a hundred tribes and nationalities.</p>

<p>The good faith of the members of the congress was soon
put to the test by David, Prince of Volhynia, who made war
upon his nephews, Vasilko and Volodar, to whom the assembled
princes had apportioned certain lands, coveted by
their uncle. The latter went to Sviatapolk, Grand Prince of
Kief—for Vladimir Monomakh had not yet come to his
throne—and represented that Vasilko had designs upon
Sviatapolk’s lands and life. The latter lent an ear to
David’s calumnies, and joined with him in a plot to seize
the person of Vasilko. The youth in fetters was brought before
an assembly of Kievan boyars (nobles) and citizens, to
be sentenced as the enemy of their prince. To this arrangement
the boyars replied with embarrassment: “Prince, thy
tranquillity is ours, and it is dear to us. If Vasilko is thine
enemy, he merits death; but if David has calumniated him,
God will avenge upon David the blood of the innocent.”
Sviatapolk hesitating to do violence to the youth, delivered
him to his uncle, who wickedly burned out his eyes. The
crime aroused the wrath of Monomakh, and of the other
kinsmen of the victim. These formed an alliance, in which
Sviatapolk was compelled to join, for the punishment of
David, who fled first to the Poles, and later to the Hungarians,
but was ultimately deprived of his principality.</p>

<p>Monomakh conducted successful wars against the Polovtsui,
the Petchenegs, the Torki, the Tcherkessi, and other
pagan nomads. In one engagement with the Polovtsui,
seventeen of their chiefs were among the captured or the
slain. One of the khans offered enormous ransom, but the
prince refused the gold, and cut the khan in pieces. These
khans were brigands, who subsisted on the booty obtained
from the Russian merchants and travelers. Monomakh
deeply felt these injuries to his Christian subjects, nor
would he treat with princes who kindled civil wars. To
the end of his days he remained “the guardian of the Russian
lands.” In his reign, the Slavs were established in
Suzdal, and founded there a city called in his honor, Vladimir;
a city of renown in the subsequent history of the empire.
The magnanimity of this prince was shown in his
giving refuge to the remnant of the Kazarui.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> In the construction
of fortifications and other buildings, and in other
industrial arts, these people were more skilled than their
conquerors. They had also numbers of flourishing schools.
In the seventh century their empire included the regions of
the lower Dnieper, the Don, the lower Volga, the shores of
the Caspian and Azof seas; an area of 765,000 square miles.</p>

<p>The commercial importance of this empire gave it high
rank in Byzantium, Arabia, and other Mohammedan countries,
these being the only civilized states of the world in
that era.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>
<p>The paper of instructions left by Monomakh, for his sons,
indicates the moral superiority of this half-barbaric prince.
As early as his day, monasticism had become a recognized
element of the national life. But he wrote: “Neither solitude
nor fasting, nor the monastic vocation will procure for
you the life eternal. Well doing alone will help you in this
world, and be put to your credit for the next. Do not bury
your riches in the earth”—a custom still practiced in Russia—“for
that is contrary to the precepts of Christianity.
Judge yourselves the cause of widows, and extend a fatherly
protection to orphans. Put to death no one, not even the
guilty; for the most sacred thing our God has made is a
Christian soul.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Strive continually to get knowledge;
and when you have learned aught that is useful, put it away
carefully in your memory. Without ever leaving his palace,
my father Vsevolod spoke five languages. This ability to
learn foreign tongues, foreigners admire in us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
have made altogether twenty-three campaigns, without
counting some lesser ones. With the Polovtsui I have concluded
nineteen treaties of peace, have taken at least a hundred
of their princes prisoners, and have restored them
their liberty; besides more than two hundred whom I threw
into the rivers. No one has traveled more rapidly than I.
If I left Tchernigof early in the morning, I arrived at Kief
before vespers.” The distance between the two cities is
eighty miles. The Russians are rapid travelers to this day.
“Sometimes amidst sombre forests I caught wild horses, tied
them together, and subdued them. How often have I been
thrown from the saddle by buffalos, thrust at by deer,
trampled upon by elands! A furious boar once tore my
sword from its belt. A bear threw my horse, and rent my
saddle. In my youth how often did I narrowly escape
death, when, thrown from my horse, I received many
wounds! But the Lord watched over me.” Such was the
Russian hero-prince of the eleventh century,—valiant,
hardy, magnanimous, pious; a sovereign whose duty did
not permit him to repose on rose leaves.</p>

<p>The regalia that, according to a tradition circulated by
the tsars of Moscow, belonged to their illustrious Kievan
ancestor, is still preserved in the museum of the former
city. It consists of a “bonnet” or crown, and collar of
Byzantine elegance; with them is a throne and a cornelian
cup, the latter said to have belonged to the Roman emperor
Augustus. According to the tradition, the whole were gifts
from the Greek emperor to his Russian kinsman, sent by
the Bishop of Ephesus, who, in solemn state, crowned
Monomakh sovereign of all Russia. The legend is an invention
for the interest of the Muscovite tsars, but the
crown and collar are still used at the ceremony of coronation:
the collar representing the burden imposed upon
him whose “shoulders” receive the weight of government.
The first manifesto of the present tsar alludes to
this painful “perilous burden.”</p>

<h3><i><a id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</i><br />

<small>IURI DOLGORUKI, AND ANDREI BOGOLIUBSKI, FOUNDERS OF
SUZDAL.</small></h3>

<p>Chief among the sons of Monomakh were Iuri Dolgoruki,
father of the princes of Suzdal and of Moscow, and Mtsislaf,
father of the princes of Galitsch and Kief. The dissensions
between kinsmen, that had been allayed by the firmness of
Monomakh, and by the congress of Lübetch, broke forth
anew upon the death of this guardian of Russian unity.
Uncles, nephews, brothers, after the fashion of royal families
in past times, fell upon one another with tooth and
talon. Iuri, bent on obtaining Kief, disturbed the repose of
the hoary Viatcheslaf, his elder brother, the grand prince.
“I had a beard when thou was brought forth,” remonstrated
the old man, citing the national law. The intractable Iuri
obtained an ally in Vladimirko, prince of Galitsch, a renegade
member of the congress of Lübetch. When reproached
for his perfidy, this Vladimirko attested the light faith of
his race, by his retort: “It was such a little cross—the one
we kissed when we took oath.” After many years of contention,
Iuri made his entrance into the capital, and had
the short-lived honor of being grand prince, but died while
a league was forming for his expulsion from the principality.
(1157.) Upon hearing of his death, one of the conspirators
exclaimed, “Great God, we thank thee for having
spared us the obligation of shedding the blood of an enemy,
a kinsman!” The lineage and name of Iuri have been preserved
through eight centuries. The paramour of the late
Alexander II, and an official attached to the Russian embassy
in England are Dolgorukis, of the blood of Rurik.
But the character of their ancestor Iuri, is not one to be adduced
with pride by his descendants. In it lay the germs of
that tenacious baseness, that persistent, unscrupulous rapacity,
that are still further developed in the succeeding
princes of his line.</p>

<p>The rivalry of the princes, together with the increasing
power of Suzdal, the remote northeastern division of Russia,
were destined to bring ruin to the ancient, magnificent
capital of the realm. Andrei Bogoliubski, son of Iuri Dolgoruki,
and prince of Suzdal, assembled an army composed
of the men of his three cities, Rostof, Vladimir, Suzdal, and
descended upon Kief. The Russia of the Forests, remote
from Byzantine and from western civilization, had been
silently developing resources of strength and of wealth from
within; and was ready, at this time, to measure lances with
the Russia of the Steppes, a region ever exposed to the
invasions of barbarians, and of rival princes who were willing
to take the barbarians into military service against
Russian kinsmen. In this state of affairs, the peaceful advance
of industrial civilization, or a firm system of government
could no longer be hoped for upon its soil. The northern
Russians took the city by assault. “Many times had
she been besieged and brought to extremity,” writes Karamsin.
“She had opened her Golden Gate to her foes; but
till that day, none had ever forced it. To their shame, the
victors forgot that they, too, were Russians. For three days
the grandson of Vladimir Monomakh pillaged the mother
of his own cities. The houses, monasteries, churches, the
Temple of the Tithe, the sacred Saint Sophia were demolished.
The precious images, the priestly vestments, the
books and the bells”—the latter especially dear to the Russian
heart—“all were despoiled or borne away by the ruthless
soldiery of Suzdal.”</p>

<p>Thus dishonored (1169) fell the capital of Oleg, Iaroslaf,
and Vladimir the Baptist; and with her was obscured the
<i>prestige</i>, the power and glory of Southern Russia. The metropolis
of the realm, in the course of subsequent events,
was transferred from the Dnieper to the Moskova. The
Russia of the Steppes, gorgeous with Byzantine art, illustrious
with the learning, the wisdom of the Orient, the
fertile, beautiful realm whose fame had reached the ends of
the earth, was left a prey to the hordes that swarmed along
its river banks, and to the Olgovitchi of Tchernigof, unrelenting
foemen, though kinsmen of her princes. Her
ancient glory was departed. Nothing was left save the
“warm soil,” the genial airs and golden sun that in the
former days had allured the mighty Variags from the borean
forests of the north.</p>

<p>Russia Slavonia was without a center. The old Slavic
love of liberty predominated again over the Variag compactness,
the cohesion necessary for the organization of a
state, Tchernigof, Galitsch, Suzdal on the frontier, and other
principalities, maintained an independent existence, and
their civil contentions waiting apparently for the coming
of another Rurik, another Iaroslaf, another Monomakh
who should bind together the divided sections of the country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and reëstablish its unity. Reëstablished it was in time,
but with marked modifications; nor were those who restored
it the simple, strong-hearted men, the fathers and
heroes of the opening era of the national history.</p>

<p>In far off Suzdal appears a new type of prince. Unlike
his gallant, light-hearted ancestor of the happy south,
swayed by conflicting passions, frank, impulsive—the men
of the new dynasty were ambitious, subtle, intriguing.
Mephistophelian in the power of their intellect, the coldness
of their affections, the inhuman absence of moral
qualities. Pitiless, unscrupulous, cruel, they attained their
ends at whatever frightful cost, at whatever sacrifice of justice.
The same type in Spain became its grand inquisitors.
“Gloomy and terrible of mien, they bore on their brows the
stamp of destiny.” Patient under ill-fortune, alert to profit
by good, they could wait many years for their opportunity,
but they never abandoned a purpose once formed. Such
were the princes of Suzdal, founders of the dynasty of the
Tzars of Moscow.</p>

<p>Iuri Dolgoruki gave form and name to this dominion of
the frontier forests, but he spent most of his time and
energy upon the conquest of Kief. To his son, Andrei
Bogoliubski, was left the care of developing the incipient
state, and of indicating in his own character and temper the
type of the future rulers of the Russias. Andrei, ill at ease
in the cities of the Dnieper, where the freedom of the citizens
sometimes conflicted with the will of the princes, withdrew
from his palace at Virishegorod and established himself
upon the Kliasma, at Vladimir, which he enlarged by
a suburb, named from its princely builder, Bogoliuboro.
A successful campaign against the Russian Bulgarians, a
compulsory alliance of several of the minor princes under
his standards, and his destruction of Kief, caused him
rightfully to be regarded as the strongest, the foremost of all
the princes. After the violation of the mother of Russian
cities, he turned his arms against Novgorod the Great, capital
of the glorious principality of that name, the state that
had chosen and called Rurik, the mighty republic of the
north. But the subjugation of this powerful city was
another affair from that of Kief. “The Kievans, accustomed
to a change of masters, fought only for the honor of their
princes,” writes Karamsin, “while the Novgorodians were
to shed their blood in defense of the laws, the institutions,
the liberties founded for them by their ancestors.” When
Mstislaf Andreivitch, captain of the army that had pillaged
“the holy city” of Kief, appeared at the gates of the free
city of Novgorod, the inhabitants took oath to die for Saint
Sophia, the citadel of their faith and their freedom. Their
Archbishop, Ivan, bearing aloft an image of the Mother of
God, moved at the head of a solemn procession around the
ramparts. Tradition tells us that the beloved Ikon, struck
by a Suzdalian arrow, turned her face toward her city, and
moistened the episcopal vestments with her tears. An
ecstasy of rage seized the freemen. A panic smote the besiegers.
“Novgorod! Saint Sophia!” a sharp cry rushed as
in a whirlwind around the ramparts. The Suzdalians fell
as falls the flock of small birds beneath the swoop of the
eagle. After the victory, the markets of Novgorod were so
crowded with Suzdalian slaves that any number could be
bought for a marten’s skin.</p>

<p>Yet in time, even the Novgorodians made terms with
their powerful subtle neighbor. Suzdal controlled the
Volga, by whose waters came the corn supplies for the great,
free city. Its citizens, “of their own free will,” according
to the invariable phrasing of their documents, agreed to accept
for their prince one of Andrei’s choosing.</p>

<p>The princes of Smolensk had been forced into an alliance
with the autocratic Andrei, but chafed under his despotic
rigors. The brother princes, Rurik, David, and Mstislaf,
disregarding his menaces, possessed themselves of Kief,
whither soon came a herald of Andrei, with the message:
“You are rebels. The principality of Kief is mine. I order
Rurik to return to his patrimony: David shall go to Berlad;
and as for Mstislaf, the guiltiest of you all, I will no longer
endure his presence in Russia.” Now the chronicles aver
that Mstislaf the Brave “had fear of no mortal being: he
feared none but God.” He cropped the hair and beard of
the herald—a mark of ignominy—and bade him take to
Andrei this response: “Up to this time we have respected
you as a father; but since you do not blush to treat us
shamefully, since you forget that you have to deal with
princes, we will pay no heed to your menaces. Execute
them if you can. We appeal to the judgment of God.”
Twenty vassals of Andrei were sent “to demonstrate the
judgment of God” under the walls of Virishegorod. Mstislaf
ingeniously succeeded in dividing the assailants, and by a
sudden sortie put them to flight.</p>

<p>Andrei so far cast off the Slavic customs of his ancestors
as to decline sharing his domains with any of the members
of his family, although the testamentary provisions of his
father, Iuri, had included these. Iuri’s widow, a Greek
princess, with her three remaining sons, was compelled to
leave Russia, and take refuge at the court of her kinsmen,
the Emperor Manuel. Nor did this first of Russian autocrats
adhere to the Variag custom of fellowship with his
drujïna. Properly speaking, he had none. His boyars
were his subjects, bound to accomplish his will, but never
consulted. If they chafed under their servitude, they were
banished from the country. Nor did he regard with greater
favor the ancient municipal liberties of the great cities;
liberties time-honored, and dating back to the original occupancy
of the Slav race. The Vetché, or assembly of citizens,
he would in no way recognize. His violation of Kief,
and his attack upon Novgorod the Great, sufficiently indicated
his hostility to their liberal institutions. In like manner
Rostof and Suzdal, the two chief cities of his State,
were obnoxious to him on account of their Vetché. At the
risk of alienating the more powerful of his boyars, he held
his residence in the suburb or town of his own founding, alleging
a divinely inspired dream and a miraculous interposition
as directing him to this spot. He essayed to develop
a new Kief out of his city, Vladimir on the Kliasma,
by crowding it with monasteries, erecting a golden gate,
and a Church of the Tithe, decorated by Byzantine and
western artists. Recognizing the priesthood as a strong
force in the civilization of a nation, he conferred wealth and
honors upon it, and propitiated its favor. He made assumptions
of unusual piety; practiced ostentatious vigils,
and gave large alms in public. Commemorative feasts
were established on the days of his more signal victories;
and strenuous efforts were made to procure the religious supremacy
of Suzdal, by instituting a Metropolitan at Vladimir.
The Patriarch of Constantinople would not consent to
this act, but later the Metropolitan for the Russia of the
Forests was secured. The designs of Andrei were vast and
premature. Ten generations of princes, ruling through
four successive centuries, were required for their ultimate
accomplishment. He outlined in the twelfth century
what was executed in the sixteenth by Ivan the Fourth, the
Terrible. Like the despots who were to spring from his
loins, he had implacable enemies; and he was overtaken by
the fate ever impending over the autocrats of the Orient and
of Russia. His boyars, exasperated beyond measure by his
iron tyranny, assassinated him in his favorite residence of
Bogoliuboro (1174).</p>

LITERATURE OF SCANDINAVIA.</a></h2>

<p class='center'>By L. A. SHERMAN, Ph. D.</p>




<h3>III.—THE EASTERN VIKINGS—THE BEGINNINGS OF
LITERATURE.</h3>


<p>We have watched, in the dim twilight preceding the
dawn of history, the coming of the first Norsemen to the
sea. They are a spirited and fearless people, and they have
chanced, if chance it is, to come to that sea on which navigation
is most hazardous and difficult. We marvel they so
quickly learn the arts of seamanship, and make the fierce
new element their dwelling place. They seem now to have
reached the country of their choice: its natural beauties
kindle in their breasts an immediate and romantic response
of affection. They are enamored of its wild haunts,
its fjords and mountains, and they are inspired by the
surging fury of the storm. But we witness, after a few
centuries of comparative inaction, a strange transformation.
The whole Norse people, without concert, without occasion,
becomes a nation of wandering pirates. They urge forth
their dragon ships, no matter whither, if only they shall
find new foemen or new coasts. With the outbreak of this
passion for booty and adventure we mark the beginning of
the viking-age. We then count two weary centuries of
violence and bloodshed, of plunder and conquest. A new
continent is discovered and colonized, a Danish dynasty is
set up in England, a Norwegian duchy is endowed in
France. Thus we witness the decline—not in defeat, but in
triumph, not by overthrow from without, but by suppression
from within—of viking-supremacy in the West. It remains
to speak of another chapter of viking-history, enacted
during this same period in the East, and by vikings
of the land.</p>

<p>In the ancient sagas frequent mention is made of Ostrogardia
or Garderike. This was the modern Russia, then
a barbarous wilderness, and inhabited by shifting tribes of
Finns. Just at the beginning of the historical era a new people
appears—the Slavs. It is another member of the Aryan
family of nations, which has sent out already into Europe
the Celtic, the Greek, the Roman, the Gothic, and the Scandinavian;
and it is probably the last remnant of the race.
These Slavs, already divided into various tribes, move westward,
take possession of the country, and lay the foundation
of the two cities of Novgorod and Kiev, destined later to become
the capitals of two Slavonic empires. Three centuries
pass. The Slavs have become attached to the home of their
choice, and are beginning to develop a civilization. But it
is the day of viking restlessness in the North, and Scandinavian
rovers are moving eastward as well as south and west.
In the early Russian chronicles we are told that in 859 A.
D. a band of Varangians or Northmen, under the leadership
of Rurik, invaded the country and began to spoil the
native tribes. In due time they attack and capture Novgorod
itself; but after a brief triumph the invaders, who
were but a handful, were expelled by an uprising of the
Slavs. Rurik and his followers made haste, not to return
to Sweden, but to push their way southward through the
wilderness, as many Northmen had done before. They
reach Constantinople, and are welcomed as recruits for the
imperial army. The vikings who had come before them
had already won the praise and esteem of the imperial
court; and so much do the Northmen grow in favor, that
we soon find the emperor will entrust himself to no other
guard of honor than a regiment of Varangian foot.</p>

<p>The Slavs and Finns in Novgorod meanwhile find the
blessings of freedom harder to bear than the authority of
their late conquerors. After two years of anarchy and internal
dissension they send messengers to Constantinople,
inviting the Norsemen, whom they had thrust out, to return
and resume the government. “We have a goodly
country,” say they, “and large. All we need is the strong
arm to keep it orderly. Come, then, be our princes, and
rule our state.” In response to this petition Rurik and his
two brothers, Sindf and Truvor, with a large following of
Varangian families, returned to Novgorod. Here Rurik established
himself as supreme ruler; and to prevent the success
of a fresh uprising of the Slavs, invited into the country
a large accession of Varangian population. To his brothers
he gave the principalities of Bielozero and Izborsk; but
they soon dying, Rurik assumed again authority. So strong
did this new Scandinavian kingdom become that we find
ere long an army raised for the storming of Constantinople.
The project was, however, abandoned, and the vikings who
had planned it contented themselves with seizing the little
province of Kiev. This also in a few years was brought under
the dominion of Novgorod. Thus was laid the foundation
of the great “Empire of All the Russias.” The bulk of
the population was composed of Slavs and Finns: the
nobles were Varangians, and Rurik was the first Czar.</p>

<p>It was but just that the superior race thus installed in the
government of this vast region should give its name to the
new nation. The first Varangians or Swedes who traversed
Russia on their way to Constantinople had been called by
the Finnish natives “<i>Ruotsalaiset</i>,” or Russians, from the
name of the district (Roden or Rosen) whence they had
come.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> This name adhered to Rurik and his followers, and
so the whole empire came finally to be called Russia. The
line of Rurik continued to furnish Czars to the Russian
throne until the death of Feodor, in 1598.</p>

<p>The work of the vikings is now finished: what is its sum?
Three-fourths of the European continent has become Scandinavian,
or has submitted to Scandinavian rule: thousands
of lives have been sacrificed, and perhaps half the wealth of
Europe has been plundered or destroyed. What is the compensation?
We can only look to history for the answer.
Here has been a great revolution; but revolutions are steps
in human progress. Progress always demands as its price
the best the age or generation has to give. The installation
of the Goths and Teutons in Europe cost five centuries of
woe and strife,—we can now see why; for it was destined to
give the world a better civilization and a better leadership.
But this leadership could not come from the Teuton alone:
he is never prompted to enterprise in the world at large; he
is never aggressive, he is strong only at home. Why then
those six generations of viking conquest and mingling with
the conquered, if not to supply this lack through the evolution
of the British nation?</p>

<p>That England is the leader of this Teutonic age, that she
alone has extended and is extending the borders of Teutonic
influence, that it was she who enabled Protestantism to triumph
and freedom to prevail, that it was she only who
could lay the phantom of mediæval despotism which Napoleon
raised—all this is undoubted. But is her leadership
after all due to admixture of viking blood? Has she not
become mistress of the seas simply because she is encompassed
by them?</p>

<p>But island states do not grow strong by privileges of the
sea; else would Ireland and Scotland have rivalled the
power of England. Then there is a much larger Scandinavian
element in the English people than is commonly supposed.
We forget that Sweyn and Canute won England
more through the Danes who were living there already than
by the aid of new invaders from Scandinavia. We can
also trace clearly in later England the Norse disposition and
character. We can find it depicted in Chaucer’s Shipman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
(prologue to the Canterbury Tales, 388-410), who, after the
lapse of four centuries, is still a viking of the old sort.</p>

<p>We find also the old quality of defiance well perpetuated.
In his work on monarchy (written about the middle of the
fifteenth century), Sir John Fortescue thus compares the
Frenchman and the Englishman: “It is cowardice and lack
of heart and courage that keepeth the Frenchman from rising,
and not poverty; which courage no Frenchman hath
like to the Englishman. It hath been often seen in England
that three or four thieves, for poverty, have set upon seven
or eight true men, and robbed them all. But it hath not been
seen in France that seven or eight thieves have been hardy
to rob three or four true men. Wherefore it is right said
that no Frenchman be hanged for robbery, for that they
have no hearts to do so terrible an act. There be therefore
more men hanged in England, in a year, for robbery and
manslaughter, than there be hanged in France for such
cause of crime in seven years.”</p>

<p>We pass now to inquire what literary monuments or
record the Northmen of the viking era have left behind
them.</p>

<p>They wrote, as is well known, by means of an alphabet of
runes. These were sixteen in number, corresponding in
value to our F, U, Th, O, R, K, H, N, I, A, S, T, B, L, M,
and Y. Their origin is unknown. From the Scandinavians
they were borrowed by the Germans and Anglo-Saxons, and
though never a common means of communication, were
nevertheless at one time written and understood from Constantinople
to Iceland. They are found preserved especially
in monumental inscriptions, of which we take the following
specimens from Stephens’s <i>Runic Monuments</i>, and Wimmer’s
<i>Runeskriftens Oprindelse:</i></p>

</p>

<p>Of the literature proper of the early Northmen, we will
consider first the Sagas. These record the exploits of great
chieftains, and are sometimes of historical value. They
were never written out in runes, but owe their preservation
to the Norwegian colonists who settled in Iceland. Some
of them were composed there, but the greater part seem to
have been brought over from the continent; and all were
kept alive by tradition, like the Odyssey and the Iliad, until
the age of writing.</p>

<p>In our last chapter we alluded to the attempts made
by the vikings who discovered Vinland, to establish a
colony there. For our first specimen we will translate
from the Saga of Thorfin Karlsefne that part which describes
the voyage of a band of these colonists, and their
landing, as some believe, on the shores of Cape Cod.</p>

<p>“Now is to be told of Karlsefne, that he, together with
Snorre and Bjarne, with their men, sailed southward along
the coast. They sailed for a long time, until they came to
a river which flowed down from the land above and into a
bay and so into the sea; there was a broad beach and
shoals there, so that it was impracticable to go up the
stream except at high water. Karlsefne with his people
sailed into the mouth of the stream, and called the place
‘Hóp’ (haven). They found there self-sown wheat-fields
where there were lowlands, and grapevines wherever hills
showed themselves. Every brook was full of fish. They
dug ditches where land met water when the tide was highest,
and when the tide went out there were halibut (holy
fishes) in the ditches. There was a great plenty of game of
all kinds in the woods. They stayed there half a month,
for pleasure, and noticed nothing [of importance]; they had
their cattle with them. But early one morning, as they
were looking around, they saw a great number of skin
boats; and poles were swinging in the air on board the
boats. It seemed as though they were swinging a wisp of
straw, and they swung them with the sun. Then said
Karlsefne: ‘What does this mean?’ Snorre Thorbrandson
answered him: ‘It may be that this is a token of peace; let
us take a white shield and carry toward them;’ and so
they did. Then the men in the boats rowed toward them,
and looked with wonder at those that were there, and went
ashore. They were dark men and ill-favored, and had ill-looking
hair. They were large-eyed, and with high (broad)
cheeks. They tarried awhile, and wondered at those they
met there, and afterward rowed away southward past the
cape.”</p>

<p>We will add also something from the celebrated Saga of
Njál. This is the story: Gunnar, a friend and neighbor of
Njál, had been sentenced to exile for murder. Njál had
prophesied, in case Gunnar should not keep his word and
leave the country, that it would lead to his death. Gunnar
did not go, and becoming thus an outlaw, was not long
after attacked by his enemies, and after a fierce resistance,
killed. The prophecy of Njál was in this way fulfilled.</p>

<p>“When all of Gunnar’s goods were put on board, and the
ship about ready for sea, then Gunnar rode to Bergthorshvál,
and to other neighboring farms to speak to the men, and
thanked them for standing by him—all those who had
given him succor. The second day after, he got ready early
to go to the ship, and told all his retinue that he was about to
ride away never to return. It seemed heavy tidings to the
men—though they looked for his coming back some day.
Gunnar bids farewell to all his friends, when he is ready
to go, and the men all went out with him. He thrust his
halberd down against the ground and swung himself into
the saddle, and Kolskeg and he rode away. They rode forward
as far as the Markarfljot. There his horse stumbled,
and Gunnar was thrown from the saddle. He chanced to
glance up at the slope, and the farm at Hlidarenda. Then
he said: ‘Fair is the sloping homestead, so that it has never
seemed so fair to me,—the whitening acres and the smooth-mown
lawn,—and I shall ride back home and not go at all.’
‘Do no such favor to your enemies,’ said Kolskeg, ‘as to
break your agreement; for no man would look for that
from you. And you may believe that so will it all come to
pass as Njál has said.’ ‘I will not go at all,’ said Gunnar,
‘and I would that you did likewise.’ ‘That shall not happen,’
said Kolskeg; ‘I shall not play the dastard in this,
nor in anything else in which my word is honored; and
there is but this alternative left: that we part here. And
tell my mother and my kinsmen that I do not expect to
see Iceland again; for I shall hear tidings of your death,
my brother, and then I shall have no desire to sail out
hither again.’ Therewith they part. Gunnar rides home
to Hlidarenda, and Kolskeg rides to the ship and sails
away.”—<i>Njála:</i> Chapter lxxv, line 20.</p>

<p class='center'>By C. E. BISHOP.</p>

<h3>IV.—THE MEADOW-PARLIAMENT.</h3>


<p>Old historians generally gave kings bad characters, but
in the reaction from this indiscriminate censure we get a
school of writers who praise too much. Treacle has taken
the place of vinegar in writing history. Thus, Green makes
heroes of the coarse Saxon savages and heathen; Froude
has painted the picture of Henry VIII so his own mother—much
more his multitudinous wives—would not recognize
it; even Benedict Arnold and Judas Iscariot have their eulogists.
Nevertheless, no one, so far as I have read, has
had a good word to say of King John. Green vouchsafes
“the sober judgment of history” in ratification of the Billingsgatish
opinion: “Foul as it is, hell itself is defiled by
the fouler presence of John.” I have no kalsomine to mix
for him who seems by all accounts to have been worse than
his Satanic Majesty, in that John <i>is</i> “as black as he is
painted.” Yet it is to this royal monster that England
owes her Great Charter of Rights and Freedom, and one of
her red letter days.</p>

<p>The boy whose impudence and mean spirit made everybody
detest him; the youth who so embittered the last
hours of his fond father, Henry II, that he died cursing
him; the prince who plotted the dethronement and death
of his brother, King Richard, absent on a crusade, and
murdered the rightful heir, the boy Arthur; the husband
who deserted his own wife and abducted the wife of his
friend; the soldier who was always provoking quarrels and
always running away from fighting, and abandoned all his
continental possessions to his enemy without striking a
blow; the churchman so abjectly superstitious that he
dared not go hunting without a string of relics around his
neck, yet quarrelled with the Pope about the right to rob
the Church revenues, and ended by basely resigning his
crown into the Pope’s hands and kissing the toe of his
legate; the lawgiver of his realm who reduced bribery to a
department of the royal exchequer, and opened book accounts
with the subjects whose hush-money and blood-money
bought justice and the perversion of justice, wherein
it was recorded that one man paid to have the king’s anger
appeased, another “that the king should hold his tongue
about Henry Pinel’s wife,” and that a poor woman paid two
hundred livres for the privilege of visiting her husband in
prison; the father of his people who hired foreign plunderers
to rob and murder his children, who starved women
and children to death in dungeons, crushed old men under
loads of lead, extorted rich men’s money by pulling their
teeth, one each day; who was so licentious that noble ladies
had to flee the realm to be safe from his approach or his
violence—this “awful example” of the race of kings was the
chosen instrument for inciting England to demand a charter
as complete in its guarantees as his encroachments, as
beneficent as he was pestilent, as monumental grandly as
he was meanly. And so at last it came about that King
John had not a friend left at home or abroad.</p>

<p>He had one opponent whom both interest and principle
moved to lead the national demand for justice,
which now took shape. That was Stephen Langton, the
Archbishop of Canterbury, whose appointment by the
Pope had been resisted by John. This worthy Saxon successor
of Anselm and Becket had hunted out in the garret
of a monastery a copy of the charter which Henry I, in the
days of his honeymoon with his Saxon wife, had granted to
his people; he had called together the barons and bishops,
and proposed that John be made to renew that bill of
rights, and they had all laid their hands on the high altar
of St. Edmondsbury and sworn to make him do so, by arms
if need be. Christmas Day, 1214, was grandly celebrated,
for then the burly knights in armor came to John in London
Temple and made their demand. The crafty king
asked time to consider of it, and to study the document.
“How long?” demanded Langton. “By Easter you shall
have my answer,” promised the king.</p>

<p>He employed the interval in begging the Pope to order
Langton to cease his opposition, which the Pope did, and
the archbishop did not. On the contrary, Langton gave to
the barons’ movement religious sanction and the title
“The Army of God and Holy Church,” thus neutralizing
the moral and spiritual influence of John’s only supporter,
Rome. John tried to buy off the opposition with promises,
but no one would trust the champion prevaricator of the
age. He sent out proclamations to all bailiffs to put down
his enemies, but everybody took pride in being his enemy,
so there was no one to execute the writs. He made a great
pretense of going on a crusade and took the cross, but even
that all-compelling appeal was laughed at. John a crusader!
See how necessary it was that this king should
have been so bad that no one would trust or believe him,
even with the Pope at his back and the cross in his hands.</p>

<p>We of this country and time—all mankind, in fact, have
to thank John for all this resistance, for the more he struggled
and plotted and lied, the more they advanced their
demands, so that by Easter “the Army of God and Holy
Church” had a far different charter to offer from that they
had sworn to before the last Christmas; like all nature at
that spring-dawn, the charter had put out new shoots.
Freedom, too, had come forth from the tomb.</p>

<p>On Easter day, 1215, the barons were assembled in large
force at Stamford; a committee headed by Langton went to
the king with the articles drawn up on parchment; the document
made a big bundle; you can see it yet in the British
Museum. If the king was astonished at the growth the
document had made, he was more so at the growth of the
demands put forth in it, and he swore up and down he never
would sign it and grant liberties to his subjects which would
make him a slave. The barons seemed to think he would
sign, nevertheless. May was nearly gone before they
brought the king to book. He tried to raise an army at
home, but no one came to his banner. He sent abroad to
hire soldiers, but they did not come. May 22, 1215, “the
Army of God” marched triumphant into London, and the
kingdom was in its hands. Scotland and Wales offered aid,
and the northern barons came marching with their retainers
to the common cause. For two weeks John skulked
about London with seven horsemen only, and all England
in arms against him. Thanks to John again for this resistance!
The barons improved the time adding new and
stricter conditions. But there was an end to it at last, and
the king sent to know when and where the papers should be
executed.</p>

<p>“Let it be at Runnymede, and on the fifteenth day of
June,” was the answer. All circumstances conspire to make
this appointment ideally, even romantically, appropriate.
Rune-mede was the Meadow of Council, a grassy strip between
the Thames and the foot-hills of Surrey, where since
old times earls and kings and the wise men had used to deliberate
and treat, in the open air as they lived. It spoke
of a time when men dared not trust each other in enclosures;
of a people in thought and temper as free and large as “all
out-doors.” On that historical spot the powers of England
who could not trust her king met the king who would trust
no one.</p>

<p>It is the middle day of “the leafy month of June,” 1215.
[How green and beautiful England is in June!] “The Army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
of God and Holy Church” has marched out from London
with a great crowd of citizens, and sat down along the
Council Meadow. A rude table is set, and on it are spread
out the fairly-engrossed parchment and writing implements.
The king rides thither from Windsor Castle. Only three or
four are with him, and they belong to the barons’ party.
John stands absolutely deserted, a picture of regal isolation
such as has been never seen before or since. Distinguished
monarch! He is smiling, courtly and complaisant,
as he well knows how to be. Yes, it affords him great pleasure
to do this for his beloved subjects.</p>

<p>“Hold,” says Langton, as the too-eager king grasps the
pen, “there is more to be considered. Your signature is to
be affixed only of your free will and desire, and you are to
here swear not to renounce this instrument on account of
anything that has taken place up to this moment, and to
keep this covenant faithfully inviolate forever.”</p>

<p>Yes, the smiling John would so swear.</p>

<p>“Then for the better fulfillment of all these conditions,
you will consent to the appointment of five-and-twenty
knights, who shall have power to enforce this contract; you
hereby give them power, in case any article is infringed by
you or your officers, to punish the offender by fine, or, if
necessary, to destrain your goods, and, in case of resistance,
to levy war against you and your castles, saving only the
safety of your person and your family; and all your subjects
shall be like yourself sworn to obedience to the twenty-five
barons, executors of this contract. In further security of
all which, the Tower and city of London are to remain in
possession of the Archbishop until this act shall be duly
and faithfully so put in execution by you.”</p>

<p>Ah, the smile has faded from the king’s face, and pale
and trembling he abruptly leaves the council and returns to
the castle. Once there he raves and stamps like a caged
madman. He froths at the mouth, rolls on the floor and
bites at every object near him. “They have given me five-and-twenty
over-lords,” roars the king repeatedly.</p>

<p>A week passed before all the formalities were complied
with, the barons remaining obstinately in camp, yielding
not one jot of their demands, and at last tiring out the king
and securing his assent to everything.</p>

<p>What is Magna Charta? What are its provisions, what
reforms did it work, what good has it done? Everybody
has heard of it, not one in a thousand probably can answer
these questions. It undertook two things—reform of existing
abuses and provisions for further justice; remedy for the
past, security for the future. Its great mission in the cause
of civilization has been as a rallying-point for popular rights
against royal encroachments. Kings and ministers in succeeding
centuries were again and again patiently brought
back to that ground and made to swear obedience to the
principle of <i>limitation of authority</i>. On this one point British
obstinacy stuck and never budged, and it is due to that
resistance and persistance for Magna Charta that limited
monarchy, and constitutional, representative government
stand where they do on the earth to-day.</p>

<p>A remarkable thing about the instrument itself is the
lawyer-like accuracy of its language and the minuteness
and fullness of its provisions, showing care in its preparation
and affording evidence of the state of the jurisprudence
and scholarship of the time, and of the extent of the
ramifications of the executive wrongs it sought to remedy.</p>

<p>But this is not a constitution, not a statement of rights; it
is a statute-law of the sort then possible, viz: in the form of a
royal edict. In each section the king ordains so and so.
Nor is it a charter in the interest of the rights of man. The
bondsmen, who made the bulk of the population of England
at that time, are not included in its benefits, and not
mentioned save once, and that exception was doubtless inserted
for the benefit of the masters, for it exempts from execution
the tools of the slave, which of course belonged to
his owner. So much for what the charter is not and does
not.</p>

<p>A large share of its articles are devoted to defining and
regulating the feudal tenure, duties and rights of the barons,
and were quite selfish in their scope, although they
mark progress as reducing ill-understood relations of king
and feudatories for the first time to a written form. But
they went further, and stipulated that all these privileges
and immunities should apply to all classes of freemen—an
important point, as it made Normans and Englishmen
equal before the law. Much space is devoted to regulating
business and commercial matters; as leasehold rights,
treatment of the estates of wards and widows, fixing the
widow’s right of dower, freeing of trade, home and foreign,
from restrictions and imposts, regulating fisheries, bridge-building,
highways, weights and measures.</p>

<p>Advancing into the domain of property and personal
rights, it fixed the terms and places of courts and opened
them freely to all; no man could be tried without witnesses,
or detained in prison without trial; borough franchises
were declared inviolable. Then came three sections which
struck at the heart of the tyrannical practices of John’s
reign:</p>

<p>Foreign officers, temporal or spiritual, were to be removed
and their holdings filled by Englishmen; and mercenary
troops were to be removed from the realm.</p>

<p>“Justice or right shall not be sold, delayed or denied to
any man.”</p>

<p>And then came the declaration of civil rights, which has
never ceased to echo wherever free institutions aspired to
live:</p>

<p>“No freeman shall be taken, or imprisoned, or disseized
of rights and property, or be outlawed or exiled, or otherwise
destroyed but by lawful judgment of his peers or the
law of the land.”</p>

<p>This grand declaration was five hundred years ahead of
the times, and was not made a fact sooner than that; but
all the same, it made the condition of “freeman” in England
a great prize for the slave to struggle for, and under all
the stormy vicissitudes of royal, baronial and clerical oppression
of succeeding ages; made the condition of men in
England infinitely superior to that of subjects of other
realms—in fact, and in the end, made England what she is,
America what <i>she</i> is as to free institutions.</p>

<p>So, on the whole, those iron-fisted old barons did their
work well, according to their light and the condition of
their times; and Runnymede has become, by their great
act, a shrine of freedom.</p>

<p>But here our thanks to John must cease. His phenomenal
wickedness had done the world all the good it could.
He did not mean it, of course. When he had signed the
charter, and as soon as the Army of God had dispersed, he
sent to the Pope for absolution from his oath, and to the
continent for an army of murderers and marauders. He
hurled upon his realm the excommunications of the Church
and the torch and sword of his mercenaries. He went
through England from end to end, as if determined to annihilate
all life and property in his wild, insatiable revenge.
His career of ruin was short. We regret that it could not
have been terminated by the sword of justice, instead of by
nature, and so have rounded up the measure of retribution.
But every writer and every reader of English history, from
that day to this, has in thought and wish constituted himself
John’s executioner, and, setting off against the glory of
Runnymede his detestable career, has learned to loathe
injustice, treachery, cowardice, and sin in high places.</p>

<p>The word of God began to be spoken to the first of the
race in Eden, and such is the beginning of the Bible. It
was only a spoken word, doubtless, for nearly twenty-five
hundred years. From generation to generation through all
the patriarchal ages it was preserved by fathers carefully
teaching it to their children. Many fragments may have
been lost, but it is no taxation of our belief that for many
centuries much of the early Word may have been carefully
treasured through the exercise of memory. We know of
marvelous instances of the power of memory. It is supposed
that the works of Homer, an elaborate poem with
careful divisions, were preserved for centuries in critical
form, by one generation repeating it to the next while it
was unwritten. It does not bear the marks of change during
these generations of its history, but is unique, precise, and
giving every evidence of being the original work of one
author, Homer. Sir Robert Peel is stated to have been able
to listen to a speech in Parliament one and a half or two
hours long, and then repeat it all verbatim, and it is also said
at the present time that Gladstone has learned Homer so
thoroughly that on hearing any line of it repeated he is able
at once to repeat the following and the preceding line.
Now Shem lived upon the earth after he came out of the ark
five hundred years, and could have thoroughly taught the
new race in Asia the story. Snatches of song and old tales
which he related might have been verbally composed in the
antediluvian period, and many think that specimens of the
same still hold their place, set like pearls in the earliest
Scripture writings. There is little doubt that Job is the first
writer whose productions are preserved. That he wrote before
Moses seems quite evident from statements easily understood;
viz., his descriptions are only of the manners and
customs of the ancient patriarchs, his religion is purely patriarchal,
the only idolatry he mentions is the worship of
the sun and moon, thus seeming to antedate the time of
their idol worship, and lastly, he makes no mention of
Sodom, Gomorrah, or Abraham, which would scarcely have
been the case had he written after Moses. Moses may
likely have read Job and have received added inspiration
from it, if, indeed, he should need more than to have received
the tables writ with God’s own finger. There are,
thus far, six pamphlets bound with sixty of later date that
make up our book. Look at the antiquity of these six venerable
fragments, written one thousand years before Homer
sang, one thousand years before either Herodotus or Confucius
was born.</p>

<p>Following these earlier Scripture writings there came to
be mentioned the rolls of the prophets, songs and sketches
of genealogies and history, so that gradually fragments,
here and there, came forth by divine direction, which, preserved
by divine care, were to enter the canon which we
have of sixty-six pamphlets, by about forty writers, the entire
authorship spanning a period of about sixteen centuries,
geographically ranging over the cities of Chaldea, the plains
of Arabia, and the mountains of Palestine. The range of
mind is equally varied; written by men who sat on thrones,
by some who lived as hermits in the mountains, and by
some who were shepherds and fishermen.</p>

<p>About 600 B. C., it is recorded in Jeremiah xxxvi that Jehoiachim,
while listening to the reading of the roll, became so
enraged at its contents that he took his penknife and defaced
it, and then cast it into the fire-place and saw it consumed.
He has had many descendants of the same temper,
and his race is not yet extinguished.</p>

<p>In about 450 B. C.—I am careful to give approximate dates
in round numbers—the sacred rolls were so mutilated that
when Ezra and Nehemiah returned from the eastern captivity
and reorganized the old worship in the city of Jerusalem,
they added to their other improvements the establishment
of a district library, Ezra collected and translated all the
copies of the Bible, writing in a kind of Chaldaic Hebrew,
the old language modified by the eastern dialect, with
which the Hebrews in their captivity had grown familiar,
so that now there were two languages of Scripture, the
Samaritans clinging tenaciously to the old Hebrew of Job,
and Moses, and the prophets after them.</p>

<p>About 280 B. C., marks another epoch in the development
of the book. Ptolemy Philadelphus, the ruler of Egypt, desired
to enrich the great imperial library of Alexandria with
a complete and careful translation of the sacred writings
into Greek, which was the popular language of his time.
He organized a college of seventy or seventy-two eminent
scholars, and classified the work among them; and the result
was the Septuagint translation, the foundation of all
our translations of the Old Testament since. It is said that
the last transcript of this work was made by the hand of a
woman named Techla. This was the edition which the Savior
and the apostles used, the very language which they
quoted and mostly spake. Between 130 and 140 B. C., Antiochus
distinguished himself by attempting to burn all the
Bibles in the world, thus acting the part of Jehoiachim No. 2.</p>

<p>In 128 A. D., Aquila made another translation, it is
thought in favor of the more zealous Jews and to the prejudice
of Christians, and not as fair a work as the Septuagint,
and in 300 A. D., Diocletian added to the infamies of the
tenth great persecution an attempt to destroy the Bible by
seizing and burning all copies that could be found. He is
Jehoiachim No. 3. Such attempts in fulfillment of the declarations
of the text are like the effort to exterminate a
ripened head of wheat by stamping it beneath your feet; the
next year many thrifty growths will laugh at the result.</p>

<p>In the early part of the fifth century good Saint Jerome,
one of the most distinguished of the Latin fathers, profound
in learning and devout of heart, collected all the important
translations that preceded him, took up his residence in
Palestine and made a very thorough version, called the
Latin Vulgate, and used by our Catholic friends ever since,
an important aid in all subsequent Bible work.</p>

<p>In 500 the Emperor Justinian decreed, to quell some discussion
about the preferences of versions, that either might
be used with entire liberty in any part of the realm. It is supposed
that the Jewish sentiment, vacillating for some time
between liberal views and their characteristic conservatism,
rebounded at this decree and led to a tenacity for their own
ancient language, to which they have since scrupulously
adhered, reading mostly throughout their wide dispersion
the ancient characters of Job and Moses, but some, as at
Frankfort in Germany, using the Chaldaic shading of Ezra’s
version. From a little before 600 we are able very definitely
to trace the way of the book in England. There was dense
ignorance among the masses of common people throughout
the middle ages, but the convents and the great monasteries
were some of them nevertheless centers of great learning.
The Jews of England from the first kept a clear knowledge of
their old writings, and furnished men in every century eminent
in scholarship. Monks, so inclined, had little else to
do but to eat and study, and God perpetuated through their
work the knowledge of his word. I was shown in the British
Museum a copy of the Gospels in Latin, of exquisite
beauty, done by Eadfrid in the seventh century. It is
on excellent paper, in red and black characters, executed
almost with the precision of type. Near the close of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
century Cædmon, the father of English poetry, translated
portions of the Scripture into the Saxon or early English.</p>

<p>A fragment of manuscript written by Aldhelm, a bishop,
in 706, praises the nuns for their fidelity in the daily reading
of the holy Scriptures, a circumstance that indicates both
that there was something of education among the convents,
and also that they doubtless had many copies of Scripture
manuscripts. Aldhelm himself is known to have translated
fifty of the Psalms into the early English.</p>

<p>A bright picture comes to us by the pen of Saint Cuthbert
in 735. On the 26th of May—Ascension Day—cloudless and
beautiful toward its closing, there were silent tread and
hushed voices among the monks of a great monastery in the
county of Durham, in England. All attention along the
cloisters was directed toward the passageway of one cell,
and eager inquiries of all who came thence if the dying one
were still alive.</p>

<p>Within the cell, on a low white bed, was the feeble form
of an old man, bolstered up that his eye might rest upon
either of the manuscripts supported in position on and about
his bed. At a table near him was seated a scribe writing
every word which the pale lips spake. One listening heard
the scribe say, “There is only one chapter left, master, but
you are too weary now, and you must sleep.” “No, go on,
it is very easy, write rapidly,” was the reply; and so the
writing proceeded according to the faint dictation of the
exhausted old man, until he seemed to fall asleep. The
scribe awoke him again, and the glassy eyes brightened as
the old man heard, “Master, there is but one verse now,”
and with an effort to fix the drooping eyes upon the adjusted
scrolls, there came slowly forth, one by one, the words
of the last verse of John’s gospel, and when the “Amen”
was pronounced, the whitened head sank among the pillows
lightened with the last rays of the setting sun, as it streamed
through the grated window, and the bloodless lips murmured
forth, “Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and
to the Holy Ghost,” when the form of the Venerable Bede
was still, and the awful silence of death followed immediately
the ending of his translation.</p>

<p>Portions of the Word were also translated in the ninth century,
and were authorized by King Alfred. He himself did
something at translating, and was careful to have nicely executed,
as a preface to every published code, the manuscript of
the Decalogue. It might exercise a salutary effect if our
statesmen, every law they read, might also have the ten
commandments before them. King Alfred made the declaration
more than once that he desired to see the day when
all men in his kingdom would be able to read God’s word.</p>

<p>Elfrac also, after Alfred, from 1004 to 1030, translated portions
of the Scriptures into English.</p>

<p>But the last manuscript translation of the English Scriptures
is greater than any which preceeded it, and the only
one which can be called a popular edition. The quaint old
stone church of Saint Mary is still standing in Leicestershire,
where John Wycliffe preached when in 1830 he completed
his translation. He had long been the fiery lecturer
at Oxford, and had come into sore conflict with ignorant
priests of the papacy for his enunciations of religious
liberty and his schemes for the better education of the
masses of the people. So that when his translation was
finished a strong hatred sought his life. He was cited to
Rome, but being too feeble to go, he was buried in his own
parish. Forty years afterward, however, the same council
which burned John Huss exhumed the bones of Wycliffe,
and having burned them, they gathered the ashes and scattered
them into the river which had the significant name of
“Swift,” down which they found their way through other
rivers into the ocean, and were washed, it would seem, with
the strength of Wycliffe’s spirit, upon every shore of the
world. There were as many as one hundred and seventy
copies of the Wycliffe version made with busy pens, and
circulated secretly, but widely read, thus preparing the way
for greater works thereafter, and confirming the propriety
of calling their author “The Morning Star of the Reformation.”</p>

<p>A few years since I stood long before the great bronze
statue of Gutenberg in Mayence on the Rhine, a place now
of over fifty thousand population. All citizens are eager to
show any American that can make out to ask it, the site of
the building where the invention of printing with movable
type was made about 1450. The house still stands where
Gutenberg lived, and another in which he did his first work
with his press. Twenty-five years later printing began in
England, and in another twenty-five years there were in the
world over two hundred and twenty places where printing
was done. I took a walk on the heights back of Bristol, in
England, and was asked if I was seeking Sudbury, the old
manor, which I was not, but accidentally had it pointed out
to me where Sir John Walsh lived, when he employed for
the instruction of his children a young priest, a fine scholar
and a great reader. The fact that he devoted so much of
his time and thought to the Scriptures, and even taught
children to read it, produced some sensation in the community.
In June, 1523, at a dining, the young priest suffered
some rebuke for his liberal handling of the Scriptures by the
pompous parish priest, who was present, and who, among
other things, declared that it was better even to disobey a
law of God than a law of the Pope. At this the opposition
in the heart of the young priest became very decided, and
his reply was almost in these words: “I hope to live to see
even the ploughboys of England knowing more of the Word
of God than either yourself or the Pope.” That young
priest’s name was William Tyndale. When it was noised
about that his pen was busy preparing a translation of the
Bible for print, he was obliged to fly abroad on the continent,
where at Cologne on the Rhine he printed a few
sheets, then fled again to Worms, where he printed all of his
translation, and was soon thereafter imprisoned in Antwerp
for six months, during which time he converted the jailor
and his family. He was then strangled and burned at the
stake, his last words being, “May the Lord open the King
of England’s eyes.”</p>

<p>It was Henry the VIII who was then King of England,
and who assisted the bishops to buy up Tyndale’s edition
and burn the books in a heap before St. Paul’s in London.</p>

<p>I saw a fragment of one of the books, mostly burned, rescued
from the flames, and now in the British Museum. This
is Jehoiachim No. 4.</p>

<p>It is said that a young man named Coverdale had been
greatly interested in Tyndale’s edition; that he was a fine
scholar, and that he, with several others, finding that the
edition would be destroyed, succeeded in selling many
copies for the flames, thus erecting a fund with which they
proposed another edition. The prayer of Tyndale in less
than two years was answered. Henry the VIII, with increasing
disgust at the ignorance and corruption of the religious
teachers in every community, determined that, after
all, the Bible should be printed and extensively circulated.
So Coverdale, with strong patronage, was employed to issue
it, which he did, under the care of Archbishop Cramer,
in 1527, in Zurich. Two thousand five hundred copies of
Coverdale’s edition were seized and burned by the Inquisition
in France. This is Jehoiachim No. 5.</p>

<p>Following Henry VIII, Edward VI ordered that every
parish priest should own a copy and read therefrom a chapter
at each service.</p>

<p>In 1558 John Calvin, with able associates, published an
edition called the Genevan edition.</p>

<p>In 1614 King James commissioned forty-seven scholars to
make a careful and complete edition, which was authorized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
as standard. This is our own edition or translation in common
use since. As Tyndale commenced his work in 1511,
you will see that it took just a century and more than fifty
years after the time of printing to produce a complete and
authorized version of God’s word. The race of Jehoiachims
in many parts have attempted to destroy it, especially in
Spain, for the last few years.</p>

<p>During the time of the preparation of King James’s version,
our Catholic friends completed an edition more to their
liking, which was published in 1609 in Douay, France, and
which they have in whatever common use it is proper to say,
called the Douay version.</p>

<p>In 1604, the same year that King James moved for his
version, John Eliot was born. In 1631 he joined the church
in Boston, and became a learned and pious missionary
among our American Indians. In 1661 he published his
translation, and lived to see over twenty Indians educated
and using his edition in their own tongue, in the pulpit.
Eliot died when he was eighty-six years old. There are
now about thirty copies of his translation remaining, about
equally divided between England and America. There is a
copy in the Astor Library in New York, and one in Yale
College library. A copy was sold at auction in New York
a few years since for $1,130, the highest known price ever
paid for one book. There is no man now living who can
read Eliot’s Bible.</p>

<p>In 1870 a movement was started, appropriately by the
Church of England, for a thorough revision of our Scriptures.
The New Testament has been in our hands for some
time, and we now eagerly look forward to the appearance of
the Old Testament in the new version.</p>

<h4><a name="FROM_THE_BEGINNING_TO_ABRAHAM" id="FROM_THE_BEGINNING_TO_ABRAHAM">FROM THE BEGINNING TO ABRAHAM.</a></h4>

<p class="center">By W. F. COLLIER, LL. D.</p>

<p><i>The Creation of Man</i> involved the necessity of preparing
a dwelling-place for him. The Bible informs us that the
world passed through successive changes, which transformed
an unshapely mass to its present condition of beauty
and fitness. God said, “Let there be light,” and the rays
of the sun burst upon the surface of the earth. Then the
land appeared from under the waters, and was clothed with
vegetation. The fishes, reptiles, and birds were called into
existence. Next, quadrupeds appeared. Finally, as a
crowning act, man was created in the image of God, his
Maker. “Then the woman was formed from the rib of the
man, in token of the closeness of their relation, and the
duty of man to love his wife as his own flesh.”</p>

<p>Man having been created, means were employed for his
occupation. In order to develop his mind and body activity
was necessary. He was to dress and keep the garden,
to subdue the lower animals, study them, and subject
them to his control and use.</p>

<p>Distinguished from all other created beings around him
by the gift of speech, he was enabled to classify and name
the animals, hold converse with his wife, and engage in
oral acts of praise and worship of his Heavenly Father.</p>

<p>The locality of the Garden of Eden is believed to be in
the highlands of Asia Minor, near the sources of the rivers
Euphrates and Tigris. The whole district drained by these
rivers is represented by travelers as one of surpassing
beauty. Mountains rise, by easy slopes, to the height of five
thousand feet; their sides are clothed with gigantic forest
trees, underneath which the box, bay, and rhododendron
flourish. The valleys and lowlands are studded with villages,
and checkered by orchards, vineyards, and gardens,
yielding both the cereals of the temperate zones and the
fruit of the tropics. Somewhere in the eastern part of this
charming district the garden was located, on the shore of
Lake Van. This lake is described by travelers as follows:</p>

<p>“The shores of Lake Van (a noble sheet of water, two
hundred and forty miles round), are singularly fine. They
are bright with poplar, tamarisk, myrtles, and oleanders,
whilst numerous verdant islands, scattered over its placid
bosom, lend to it the enchantment of fairy land. In one
direction the gardens cover a space of seven or eight miles
long, and four miles broad. The climate is temperate, and
sky almost always bright and clear. To the southeast of
the lake extends the plain of Solduz, presenting in one part
an unbroken surface of groves, orchards, vineyards, gardens,
and villages. The same description is applicable to
the tract extending along the Araxes, which, for striking
mountain scenery, interspersed with rich valleys, can
scarcely be equalled. This district accords, in every respect,
with the best notions we can form of the cradle of the
human race.”</p>

<p>Here, say the Armenians, was the Vale of Eden. On
the summit of Mount Ararat, at no great distance from
this, the ark rested; and here, also, the vine was first cultivated
by Noah. It is impossible to say whether further investigation
in this comparatively unknown district will
ever guide us nearer to the spot where the Lord planted
the garden; but there can be no doubt that these plains,
lakes, and islands must have given birth to the images of
Elysian fields and Fortunate islands that continued, age
after age, to gild the traditions of the world.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p><i>The Fall of Man.</i>—This expression signifies the loss of the
innocence and perfection with which he was endowed at
his creation. The Fall was the consequence of disobedience.</p>

<p>Milton thus describes the momentous event:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>At what period of the existence of our first parents their
fall occurred the inspired writer does not inform us. The
<i>fact</i> is only stated. There is reason to infer that it occurred
soon after their creation.</p>

<p>Before the fall they lived in the garden, whose enchanting
beauty has already been described. Their employment
was to dress, admire, and enjoy the lovely spot, and to
praise and glorify their Maker.</p>

<p>Having disobeyed, they were driven forth from the garden,
and the ground, which before brought forth, spontaneously,
an abundant supply of fruits to satisfy all their desires,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
became changed, and needed cultivation to produce
the food their desecrated bodies needed.</p>

<p>“Adam and Eve went forth into the wide world, carrying
with them the fallen nature and corrupt tendencies
which were the present fruit of their sin, but with faith in
the promise of redemption.”</p>

<p>The chief object of their life was yet to be accomplished,
the earth was to be peopled and subdued. The curse was
accompanied by a promise. The toils of the man were to
be rewarded by the fruits the earth would yield to cultivation;
and the woman, in her suffering, was consoled by
the hope of a Redeemer.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p><i>The Flood.</i>—Sin and wickedness had become so wonderful
that God determined to destroy the whole race, except
Noah and his family.</p>

<p>Noah was directed to construct a vessel sufficiently large
to accommodate his family and such animals as he should
need. In this vessel, called in the Bible the Ark, he embarked
with his wife, three sons, and their wives, making
in all eight souls. He took, according to Divine direction,
clean beasts and birds by sevens, and of such as were not to
used for food or for sacrifice by pairs, with a supply of
food for all. The age of Noah at the time he entered the
ark was six hundred years. When all had embarked, the
ark was shut by the hand of God, and immediately the fountains
of the great deep were broken up, and the clouds sent
forth torrents of water, which increased and bore up the ark.
The Bible does not describe the terrific character of the
consequences of such a storm. We are left to imagine the
scenes that followed. The mountain streams must have
swollen so suddenly as to forsake their channels and find
new outlets, sweeping away, in their angry force, hamlets,
villages, and even cities, washing down hills, and undermining
mountains. But, most prominent, there rises before
the fancy a scene of terrible conflict—brawny men
fighting with the tempest, carrying their families from
height to height, but still pursued by the remorseless, unwearying
foe.</p>

<p>The next scene is one of defeat and death.</p>

<p>Bleached and bloodless corpses float everywhere, like
pieces of a wreck over the shoreless sea; the poor babe,
locked in the arms of the mother, having found even nature’s
refuge fail.</p>

<p>Last of all, there is a scene of awful stillness and desolation,
not one object being seen but the dull expanse of the
ocean, nor one sound of life heard but the low moan of its
surging waters.</p>

<p>On the seventh month the ark rested on the mountains of
Ararat. But nearly a year elapsed, after the mighty vessel
grounded, before Noah emerged from this temporary
prison. Immediately upon landing he erected an altar,
and offered sacrifice to God for preserving him from the
watery grave which had engulfed all mankind except his
family, with which act, God being well pleased, he made a
covenant with him never again to destroy the world by
flood, and to seal the promise, he set his bow in the cloud.</p>

<p>Noah, as has been stated, on going out of the ark, celebrated
his deliverance by a burnt offering of all the kinds
of clean beasts which he had preserved in the ark with
him.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p><i>Babel.</i>—The next great event in man’s history was the
confusion of tongues, and the consequent dispersion of mankind
into three great lingual families.</p>

<p>On leaving the ark new privileges were granted, new
laws imposed, and a new covenant made. In addition to
the plants, all animals were allowed for food. They were
forbidden to eat blood, and murder was made a capital
offence. “Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his
blood be shed.” We may infer that the sons of Noah, and
their descendants, moved naturally toward the south, until,
after many years, they reached and settled the plains south
of Ararat; until Assyria, the plains of Mesopotamia, and
Chaldæa swarmed with busy multitudes, pursuing the
various avocations of life.</p>

<p>It was on the plains of Chaldæa, south of Mesopotamia,
that the mighty city of Babylon arose on the banks of the
river Euphrates, where the inhabitants, in their pride, attempted
to erect a tower that should reach to the heavens.
This tower was, no doubt, intended to serve as a place from
which to expose signals to call the people together, hence it
was to be high enough to be seen from all parts of the plain.</p>

<p>To humble their pride, and to people other sections by
distribution, God arrested the work by confounding of
tongues, so that when the workmen asked for brick the
laborers brought mortar. It is not certain to how great an
extent the confusion of tongues was brought; but it is not
believed that each person spoke a different dialect from
every other. But, on the other hand, there is reason to believe
that the whole was divided into three great lingual
divisions or families.</p>

<p>Men now grouped together, from necessity, into tribes or
families, composed of those who understood each other,
sought new regions and neighborhoods where they might
settle, and engage in the various departments of human industry
then practiced.</p>

<p>In that mild climate and generous soil men were greatly
tempted to become shepherds and herdsmen, a mode of life
at once simple and healthful, and one highly calculated to
extend the borders of occupation, and increase the population.</p>

<p>The government was patriarchal—a mode of government
which seemed to have been especially acceptable to God,
and well calculated to prevent centralization.</p>

<p><i>Social Life of the Ancients—Job.</i>—It would be utterly impossible,
in any single picture, to present a view of the
state of society during a period of so great extent, and embracing
such a variety of nations and countries. We can
but follow the example of the Bible itself, and make choice
of a single spot, and a single family, to convey some idea
of the life and manners of the age. It is probable that it
was during this period that the patriarch Job lived, suffered,
and triumphed. Job was probably a descendant of
Shem; his residence is said to have been “in the east”
(Job i. 3)—the term usually applied to the district where
the first settlement of men took place. (Gen. ii. 8; iii. 24;
xi. 2). The Sabeans and Chaldæans were his neighbors;
and at the time when he lived the knowledge of the True
God seems to have been preserved, without material corruption.
The adoration of the heavenly bodies had begun
to be practiced (Job xxxi. 26, 27), but there seems still to
have been a general belief in one Almighty God.</p>

<p>The picture of social life in the book of Job is in many
respects extremely beautiful. We dare not regard it as a
sample of what was usual over the world, but rather as exhibiting
the highest condition of social life that had been
attained. There were even then cases of oppression, robbery,
and murder; but, for the most part, a fine patriarchal
purity and simplicity prevailed. The rich and the poor met
together, and to the distressed and helpless the rich man’s
heart and hand were ever open: “When I went out to the
gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the
street, the young men saw me, and hid themselves: and
the aged arose and stood up.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When the ear heard
me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave
witness to me; because I delivered the poor that cried, and
the fatherless, and him that had none to help him. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me,
and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.” The sweet
bonds of family affection retained all their power in the
household of Job; his children feasted by turns in each
other’s houses; while the affectionate and pious father rose
early in the morning to offer sacrifices for them all, lest
any of them should have sinned. The simple burnt-offering
retained its place as the appointed ordinance of heaven,
and was the sacrifice that Job, as the high-priest of his
house, presented on behalf of his children.</p>

<p>In the book of Job mention is made of kings, princes, nobles,
judges, merchants, warriors, travelers, and slaves.
The pen of iron had begun to engrave inscriptions upon
rocks; the mining shaft was sunk for gold and silver; and
palaces that had been built for kings and nobles had fallen
into ruin. Astronomy had begun to acquaint men with
the heavenly bodies, and many of the stars and constellations
had received well-known names. Altogether, the
state of civilization was highly advanced. The more closely
we study those early times, the more erroneous appears
the opinion that man began his career as a savage, and
gradually worked his way up to refinement and civilization.
The reverse of this is nearer the truth. “God made man
upright”—civilized and refined, as well as intelligent and
holy; but as man departed from God, he lost these early
blessings. Sometimes a considerable degree of refinement
has been reached by other paths; but by far the richest and
best civilization is that which has come with true religion—with
the pure knowledge and simple worship of the one
True God.</p>

<h4><a name="FROM_ABRAHAM_TO_THE_OCCUPATION_OF_CANAAN" id="FROM_ABRAHAM_TO_THE_OCCUPATION_OF_CANAAN">FROM ABRAHAM TO THE OCCUPATION OF CANAAN.</a></h4>

<p class='center'>By W. F. COLLIER, LL. D.</p>

<p><i>Call of Abraham.</i>—The next important step chronicled
in the Mosaic history of man is the call of Abraham, ten
generations after Noah. Abram was born 1996 B. C. Ur, a
Chaldæan city, was his birthplace. Terah, Abram’s father,
removed from Ur to Haran, in Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>The Lord spake to Abram while residing in Haran, when
he was seventy-five years old, and commanded him to
leave his father’s house, to separate himself from his kindred,
to depart from his country, and to go to a land that
should be shown him.</p>

<p>The Lord said to him, “I will make thee a great nation,
and will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou
shalt be a blessing. And I will bless them that bless thee,
and curse him that curseth thee. And in thee shall all the
families of the earth be blessed.” Abram, in obedience to
this command, set out with his wife Sarai, and his nephew
Lot, taking with him his flocks and herds, and journeyed
into the land of Canaan. Having arrived, his first act was
to erect an altar, and sacrifice to the Lord. From this
place he moved to the east of Bethel, and again built an
altar and worshipped. A famine drove him from his new
home into Egypt, where was an abundance of food. Having
spent some time in the land of the Pharaohs, he returned
to Canaan, greatly enriched by his sojourn in Egypt.
Soon after the return from Egypt Lot separated himself
from Abram, and settled in the valley of the Jordan, while
Abram sought the hill country, and finally sat down in the
neighborhood of the ancient city of Hebron. The king of
Chaldæa made a raid on the cities of Canaan, and carried off
Lot, with other prisoners. This fact coming to the knowledge
of Abram, he immediately set out to rescue his relation.
Having over three hundred servants, he attacked
the camp of the invaders at night, set them to flight, and
rescued his nephew.</p>

<p>This is the first battle recorded in history.</p>

<p>When Abram was one hundred years old the Lord’s
promise was renewed to him. His name was changed to
Abraham, the name of his wife to Sarah; and Isaac, through
whom the promise of a great progeny was to be fulfilled,
was born. When Isaac was forty years old, Abraham sent
his servant to Mesopotamia to obtain a wife for him. His
second cousin, the grand-daughter of his father’s brother,
was selected, and she consented to go back with the servant
and marry her kinsman. From this marriage two sons
were born, Esau and Jacob. By the right of birth Esau
possessed certain advantages, which Jacob purchased of
him by dressing him some food when returning faint and
hungry from the chase, thereby supplanting him. He afterwards,
by deceiving his father, who was nearly blind,
obtained from him the parental blessing conferred only
upon the first born. This so enraged his brother, that
Jacob sought safety in flight, and went to his mother’s
brother in Mesopotamia. There he was kindly received,
and after a short time had elapsed he entered into the service
of his uncle, and agreed to labor for him seven years
for his youngest daughter. Having fulfilled his part of the
contract, Laban, his uncle, gave him his <i>eldest</i> daughter.
When Jacob discovered the deception his father-in-law had
practiced upon him, he demanded Rachel. Laban, however,
required him to serve another seven years, which he
did. After the second marriage he continued still to live
with Laban, and received as pay a share of his flocks. In
securing this share, he was thought by his brothers-in-law
to have practiced unfair means, hence they became hostile
to him. His father-in-law also having become unfriendly,
he fled, and returned to his native land with his family and
his flocks. Laban pursued and overtook him, and though
their meeting was far from being friendly, they entered into
an agreement, and gave pledges that they would not annoy
each other in future. Jacob then pursued his journey. As
he approached his native country he sent presents to his
brother Esau, who came out to meet him, and they became
reconciled.</p>

<p>Jacob journeyed on to Canaan, and sat down in the city
Shalim. Soon after he removed to Hebron, the home of
his childhood. He was rich in flocks and herds, and his
neighbors respected and feared him. In accordance with
the patriarchal mode of life, his twelve sons and one daughter
remained with him, who, with their wives, children,
and servants, made a large family or tribe.</p>

<p><i>Joseph.</i>—Jacob treated the children of Rachel, his beloved
wife, with greater tenderness than he did those of Leah, his
first wife, and Joseph was his favorite. The partiality shown
to this son so enraged his brothers that they determined to
get rid of him. They found an opportunity to carry out
their design under the following circumstances. The older
brothers having been absent with their flocks so long that
their father became anxious about their safety, and sent Joseph
to search for them. As they beheld him afar off they
plotted to murder him; but, taking the advice of Reuben,
they imprisoned him in a pit in the wilderness. Soon after
his confinement a caravan of traveling merchants passed,
and to these they sold Joseph into slavery, telling their
father that he had been destroyed by wild beasts. The merchants
carried him into Egypt, and disposed of him to Potiphar,
the commander of the king’s guards. In Potiphar’s
house he rose to great eminence as a servant; but falling
into disgrace through a false accusation, he was thrown into
prison. While in prison his conduct was so exemplary and
submissive, that he gained the favor of the jailor, and was
allowed the freedom of the prison. Later on he was summoned
to appear before the king to explain certain dreams
which troubled Pharaoh. Appearing before the great monarch,
Joseph disclaimed all power in himself to explain the
meaning of what had appeared to the mind of the king, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
modestly and reverently said the Lord of his fathers would
show the signification. The king having told his dreams,
Joseph predicted seven years of great plenty, to be succeeded
by seven years of dearth, and advised Pharaoh to build vast
granaries and fill them, during the years of abundance. The
advice was immediately acted upon, and Joseph was elevated
to the rank of governor of all Egypt, and the erection
of storehouses, and the filling of them with grain, was entrusted
to him. The years of plenty came and passed away,
and were succeeded by tedious years of sore famine. While
the Egyptians had stores of food laid up by the providence
and foresight of Joseph, the neighboring nations, having
exhausted their stock of provisions, were obliged to go to
Egypt to buy. The dearth oppressing the inhabitants of
Canaan, Joseph’s brothers came down to purchase also.
While on a second visit to buy food, they were made aware
that their despised and hated brother, whom they had sold
into slavery, was the governor of Egypt.</p>

<p>Having made himself known to them, they were overwhelmed
with surprise and fear; but he most magnanimously
pardoned and comforted them by saying, “Be not
grieved or angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither, for
God did send me before you to preserve life.” (Genesis xlv:
5, 7.) “God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity
in the earth, and to save yourselves for a great deliverance.”</p>

<p>Joseph’s father and all his family were at once brought
into Egypt, and established with their flocks and herds on
the eastern bank of the lower Nile, where Joseph nourished
them, and where they prospered for many generations,
until a new king arose, who knew not Joseph.</p>

<p><i>The Exodus.</i>—The part of Egypt in which Joseph had settled
his family was one of the most fertile parts of the valley
of the Nile. Skirted on the south by hills, it sloped off to
the northwest toward the Mediterranean Sea, thus affording
the most favorable exposure for the purpose of the pastoral
life which the Israelites led. For more than a century they
pursued their quiet employment, and were treated by the
Egyptians with respect and consideration, in memory of
Prince Joseph. The prosperity and increase of the Israelites,
with their distinctness as a people, alarmed the Egyptian
powers, who turned their attention to some means to
cripple them and arrest their increase. Oppression was resorted
to. Privileges were withheld, and severer tasks imposed,
until one tremendous groan went up from the land
of Goshen to the God of their fathers. In spite of all the
oppression and injustice practiced upon this people, they
throve and increased in numbers.</p>

<p>The Lord heard the cry of the outraged Hebrew slave, and
permitted his enemies to afflict him, that he might find the
country hateful, and feel that he was only a sojourner, who
was to seek a promised land, the land promised to his father,
Abraham. Their burdens became intolerable. Moses, their
leader, applied to Pharaoh to allow them to depart from the
country; but the king refused, and God afflicted the Egyptians
with dreadful plagues, until they prayed the Israelites
to depart. They set out with all their effects, moving toward
Arabia, and on reaching the shores of the Red Sea
they became aware of the fact that Pharaoh, with his army,
was pursuing.</p>

<p>Hemmed in on either side by hills, the sea before them,
and their enemies behind, they were overwhelmed with
despair. But now the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of
Jacob, their fathers, delivered them with a great deliverance,
for, at his command, the sea opened and allowed them to
pass over in safety. Pharaoh, pursuing, led his chariots and
horsemen into the bed of the sea, and the returning waters
engulfed them. All were destroyed, not <i>one</i> escaped; a terrific
exhibition of the wrath of the Almighty. The Israelites
journeyed on toward Canaan, the land of promise, spending
forty years in the desert of Arabia, living in tents, subsisting
on manna, which they found on the ground in the
morning, and on the flesh of birds, which came to them
every evening, making their whole journey a series of miracles
and special providences. They finally reached the
Jordan, which, like the Red Sea, opened for them, and allowed
them to pass over dry-shod. The inhabitants of the
land were driven out, and the weary wanderers, who had
crossed and recrossed their path in the rocky wilds and desert
sands of Arabia, sat down in the land of their fathers,
and became dwellers in permanent habitations.</p>

<h4><a name="THE_ISRAELITES_AFTER_REACHING_THE_LAND_OF" id="THE_ISRAELITES_AFTER_REACHING_THE_LAND_OF">THE ISRAELITES AFTER REACHING THE LAND OF
PROMISE.</a></h4>

<p class='center'>By W. F. COLLIER, LL. D.</p>

<p>Between the time of the entry of the Israelites into Canaan
and the birth of our Savior, a period of 1,451 years elapsed.
It is not our object to follow out the history of this wonderful
nation, yet it would seem necessary to state briefly their
progress.</p>

<p>For several centuries they remained much in the same
state as Joshua, their great captain, left them; contending
with the surrounding tribes whenever their encroachments
were disputed, at other times living friendly with them;
not only intermarrying, but allowing themselves to be seduced
into idolatry; for which sin the Lord permitted the
neighboring nations, in more than one instance, to conquer
them, to break up their government, and carry the principal
inhabitants into captivity. In each case, however, after
long and weary years of captivity, their country was restored
to them, and the spoilers themselves were made instruments
in the hands of God to reconstruct the nation.</p>

<p><i>Social and Religious Condition.</i>—During the forty years
of wandering in the wilderness, very little opportunity was
afforded for the exercise of the arts of life. It is difficult to
conjecture the employment of that vast multitude during all
those years.</p>

<p>The construction of the tabernacle and its furniture called
into use the skill and workmanship of the best artisans;
but, aside from that, there was nothing to tax their talent.
During the forty years they lost the arts they had learned in
Egypt.</p>

<p>For many years after they entered the Holy Land their
mode of living was rude and simple, depending mainly upon
the produce of their flocks and herds for sustenance. We
have reason to infer that they also drew upon the same
source for many articles of clothing.</p>

<p>The forty years of pilgrimage in the wilderness swept into
the grave nearly all the vast multitude that left Egypt with
Moses. Those who entered the Holy Land had not witnessed
the idolatry of Egypt. Moreover, their very existence
had depended upon the fall of the manna. Witnessing
this daily miracle, a spirit of dependence and submission
must have engrafted itself upon this new generation.</p>

<p>The dreary chastisement of the forty years, the plagues
that once and again made such havoc, the sad fact that the
bones of their fathers were left to whiten in the wilderness,
must have produced a terrible impression. The people who
came out from Egypt were haughty, unbelieving, rebellious.
Their descendants, humbled by chastisement, made dependent
by their helplessness, became gentle, submissive, and
obedient. We must hence infer that they remained for
many years simple in habit and devotional in spirit.</p>

<p>For three hundred and thirty-two years after the death of
Joshua, the successor of Moses, the Israelites were governed
by judges. During this period the Jews were a nation of
farmers, and each farmer was the proprietor of his own farm.
The size of the farm allotted to each family may at first
have averaged from twenty to fifty acres; and as there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
very few servants or laborers, except such hewers of wood
and drawers of water as the Gibeonites, each family had to
cultivate its own estate. The houses were seldom built
apart from each other, like the farm houses of our own country—that
would have been too insecure; they were placed
together in villages, towns, and cities; and when the place
was very much exposed, and of great importance, it was
surrounded by a wall.</p>

<p>The lands were adapted chiefly for three kinds of produce—grain,
fruit, and pasture. Wheat, millet, barley, and
beans were the principal kinds of grain; flax and cotton
were also cultivated, and small garden herbs, such as anise,
cummin, mint, and rue. (Mat. xxiii: 23.)</p>

<p>The orchards were exceedingly productive. The olive,
fig, pomegranate, vine, almond, and apple were all common;
and a great part of the time of the Hebrews, in days of peace,
must have been spent in cultivating these fruit trees.</p>

<p>As beasts of burden they had the ox, the camel, and the
ass; while sheep and goats constituted the staple of their
flocks.</p>

<p>Their grain harvest began about the beginning of our April,
and lasted for about two months. Summer followed, in
June and July, and was the season for gathering the garden
fruits. The next two months were still warmer, so that the
sheep shearing would have to be overtaken before they set
in. During all this time little or no rain falls in Palestine.
The country becomes excessively parched, the brooks and
springs dry up, and almost the only supply of water is from
the pools and reservoirs that have been filled during the
winter.</p>

<p>October and November are the seed time. “The former
rain” falls now. It often falls with violence, fills the dry
torrent-beds, and illustrates our Savior’s figure of the rains
descending, and the floods coming and beating upon the
houses. (Matt. vii: 25, 27.) December and January are the
winter months, when frost and snow are not uncommon;
February and March are also cold. “The latter rains” fall
at this season. About the end of it, “the winter is past, the
rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth; the
time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the
turtle is heard in the land; the fig tree putteth forth her
green figs, and the vines with the tender grapes have a good
smell.” (Song of Sol., ii: 11, 13.)</p>

<p>Among the wild trees and vegetable products of the country
were the cedar, stable and lofty, an emblem of usefulness
and beauty (Ps. xcii: 12); the oak, both the smooth and the
prickly sort, which grow in great luxuriance in Bashan; the
terebinth, or turpentine tree (translated <i>oak</i> in our Bibles),
a large evergreen, with spreading branches, often growing
singly, and so striking as to mark a district—like the terebinth
of Shechem, of Mamre (or Hebron), and of Ophrah;
the fir, the cypress, the pine, the myrtle, and the mulberry.
The oleander and the prickly pear flourished in most situations.
The rose and the lily were the common flowers.
Altogether, the number of vegetable products was large and
varied; and, in such a country, Solomon’s memory and acquirements
could not have been contemptible, when “he
spake of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon unto the
hyssop that springeth out of the wall.”</p>

<p>The ordinary employments of the Hebrew farmer were
thus ample and varied, but not very toilsome; and often
they were pleasantly interrupted. Thrice a year the males
went up to Shiloh, to the three great festivals—Passover,
Pentecost, and Tabernacles. Each seventh day was a holy
Sabbath to the Lord, devoted to rest and worship. At each
new moon there was also a holy day. Each seventh year
was a year of rest, at least from the ordinary occupations of
the field and the garden: it was probably turned to account
in repairing houses, clothes, and implements, and particularly
in the religious instruction of the people. The education
of the children was chiefly in the hands of their parents,
assisted by the Levites, who were scattered over the
country, and paid from the tithes of the whole produce. On
the whole, the Hebrews, in times of peace, led, during this
period, a quiet, unambitious, country life.</p>

<p>Occasionally, as in the song of Deborah, we meet with
proofs that music, and song, and literary culture were not
neglected; and the “divers colors of needlework on both
sides,” for which the mother of Sisera waited so anxiously
at her window, showed that the Hebrew ladies had acquired
no mean skill in the use of their needles. But, on the
whole, neither learning, nor the mechanical arts, nor manufactures,
nor commerce, nor the fine arts, were very vigorously
cultivated, or made much progress during this period.
Each man was content to sit under his vine and under his
fig tree; and the children of a family were usually quite
pleased to divide the possessions, and follow the occupations
of their fathers.</p>

<p>The government of the country was carried on chiefly by
local officers. It is not easy to ascertain the precise number
and nature of the departments of the government, or of
the officers by whom they were carried on. But each of the
twelve tribes seems to have had a government of its own.
Each city had its elders, and each tribe its rulers and princes.
In ordinary cases, justice seems to have been administered,
and local disputes settled by the tribal authorities. There
seem also to have been certain central tribunals. In particular,
there was “the whole congregation of Israel”—a
sort of house of commons, or states-general, composed of
delegates from the whole nation, by whom matters of vital
importance to the whole country were considered.</p>

<p>In ordinary times, the high priest seems to have exercised
considerable political influence over the nation; and in
pressing dangers, the judges were invested with extraordinary
powers. The whole of the twelve tribes were welded
together, and had great unity of feeling and action imparted
to them, through the yearly gatherings at the great
religious festivals. When idolatry prevailed in any district
of the country, these gatherings would be neglected, and the
unity of the nation consequently impaired.</p>

<p>No important addition was made during this period to
the religious knowledge of the people. There was no new
revelation of the Messiah, except in so far as the several deliverers
who were raised up foreshadowed the Great Deliverer.
The ceremonial law of Moses was probably in full
operation during the periods of religious faithfulness. The
great lesson regarding sin—its hatefulness in God’s eyes,
and the certainty of its punishment—was continually renewed
by the events of providence.</p>

<p>Those who really felt the evil of sin would see in the sacrifices
that were constantly offered up a proof that God can
not accept the sinner unless his sin be atoned for through
the shedding of blood. But even pious men had not very
clear ideas of the way of acceptance with God. A humble
sense of their own unworthiness, the spirit of trust in God’s
undeserved mercy for pardon, and a steady, prayerful endeavor
to do all that was right in God’s sight, were the great
elements of true piety in those days. There was great occasion
for the exercise of high trust in God, both in believing
that prosperity would always follow the doing of his will,
and in daring great achievements, like those of Barak and
Gideon, under the firm conviction that he would crown them
with success.</p>

<p>But in a religious point of view this period was a very
checkered one; sometimes one state of things prevailed,
sometimes another. The people showed a constant inclination
to forsake the pure worship of the true God, and fall
into the idolatry of their neighbors. The oppressions which
those very neighbors inflicted on them, and the wars which
ensued, generally produced an antipathy to their religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and other customs, which lasted for some years; but the old
fondness for idolatry returned again and again.</p>

<p>It clearly appears that a pure, spiritual worship is distasteful
to the natural heart. Men unconverted do not relish
coming into heart-to-heart contact with the unseen
God; they are much more partial to a worship conducted
through images and symbols: for this reason the Israelites
were always falling into idolatry; idolatry led to immorality;
and both drew down on them the judgments of their
offended God.</p>

<h2><a name="DRIVING" id="DRIVING">DRIVING.</a></h2>


<p>There is now no branch of outdoor education of greater
importance than that of an ability to “handle the ribbons.”
Not a man or woman but would be ashamed to say that
they were incompetent, if in fair health and strength, to
pilot their own carriage. And yet, though so large a proportion
of society can boast a smattering of the science,
there is no pursuit in which perfection is proportionately so
rarely attained.</p>

<p>The first requisite for a tyro is to learn to sit well, and so
to acquire the proper scope for his own power over his horse.</p>

<p>The seat should be above, or at least on a level, with the
horses’ heads, not below them; and it should, moreover, be
so placed that the driver can use his legs and feet to restrain
the pull of the horses if necessary, and that can not be done
if the reins pull down over the splash-board into the driver’s
lap.</p>

<p>Though most tyros begin their essay with a horse in a
single harness, yet in a general way it is easier and safer to
drive a pair than one. If the single horse is perfect in manners,
all that has to be learned is to keep him straight, and
to direct him without collision. But if a horse has faults he
is safer with a companion; though if the two have coincident
faults, or could confabulate mischief together, they
would be more dangerous than a single animal, yet it is in
practice long chances against the two both doing wrong
simultaneously. Each is a check on his fellow: the one
may not want to bolt when the other does, or if one falls the
other will probably keep his legs.</p>

<p>The tyro should take his seat uprightly and squarely,
plant his feet well in front of him, grasp his reins firmly,
and let his left arm play lightly from the <i>shoulder</i> (not the
elbow), his elbows both well squared. Nothing looks so
slovenly, or entails such waste of necessary power, as a
slouching back, and hands sunk in the lap.</p>

<p>The whip should not always be used because it is handy;
it is wanted to make a horse take hold of his collar if he
shirks, and to feel his bit if he hangs back when there is
difficulty in navigation. Unless he runs up to his bit there
is little or no communication between him and his driver.
The whip should be used from the wrist, not from the arm;
a lash delivered from the shoulder is far less effective and
much more ugly than a stroke from the wrist. A good fly-fisher
never makes a bad whip in this respect.</p>

<p>Let the beginner commence by casting an eye over his
harness; at first, rather that he may learn by inspection the
place for everything and that everything is in its place; but
later, when he has passed his apprenticeship, he should
still do the same, and this time with a master’s eye, to see
that nothing is wanting before he mounts to his seat. Let
him note that the breeching, if in single harness, is neither
so loose as to be useless, nor so tight as to hamper the action
of the horse and to rub the hair off. Let him see that the
rein is on the proper bar of the bit; else, if the horse has
been accustomed to be driven from one bar, and his bitting
is suddenly altered, his manners will probably change at
the same time. If he is driving double harness, let him
note the length of his traces, and see that his horses are
properly “poled up,” else the carriage will overrun them
down hill.</p>

<p>Having cast a careful glance round his harness, the driver
will then proceed to mount.</p>

<p>Let him take the reins in his hand before he mounts the
box, then, when seated, let the “near” or left hand rein
pass between the forefinger and thumb, the “off” or right-hand
rein between the fore and middle fingers—palm of the
hand uppermost. Then let the grasp of all the fingers close
tightly on the loop of the rein, which should pass out under
the remaining fingers. Though the grasp should be tight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the touch should be light; let not the exercise of the muscles
of grip confuse the driver into adding to this a tug from his
shoulder upon his horse’s mouth. However light a horse’s
mouth is, or supposing he is a slug, that does not take his
collar and run up to his bit, still the driver should always
<i>feel</i> the mouth, else he has no control over him in sudden
emergency if the reins are hanging loosely. There is
more danger in driving a sluggish or dead-mouthed horse
in a crowd than a free goer. The latter runs up to his bit
at once, and so feels your orders; the slug does not feel, and
may interpret a touch of the reins to direct him into an order
to stop in the teeth of a Pickford’s van, or on a level railway
crossing in sight of an express. Whipcord must keep
a slug to his collar, and so to his bit, or the absence of constant
communication between his mouth and his driver’s
hand may lead to collisions.</p>

<p>And now in the seat, and the grasp of the reins first secured,
let the tyro make a start; not in a hurry, not with an
instant dose of whipcord—a word of encouragement to his
horse should suffice at first. Let him learn to allow free
room for his own wheels in turning corners or passing obstacles:
he has got two things to provide for, his vehicle as
well as the horse. Better give a wide margin at first than
collide; though before long his eye will guide him, and he
need not then make himself conspicuous as a greenhorn by
giving too wide berths at corners and rencontres. Go steadily
round a corner; remember there is such a thing as centrifugal
force; and a two-wheel vehicle, high hung, may
easily be upset to the outside by a hasty whisk round a
sharp corner, even without the help of a bank to lift the
inner wheel.</p>

<p>Then, as to the rule of the road. If he meets anything
coming the opposite way, he must take it on his right hand;
if he overtakes it, on his left; if he is overtaken he must
keep to the left, and be passed on the right.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The role of the road is a paradox quite,</div>
<div class="verse">For if you go right you go wrong, and if you go left you go right.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Down hill he should progress carefully, especially when
on two wheels, for then the extra weight of the cart hangs
on the pad or saddle on the horse’s back. A stumble and
fall will probably break the shafts, certainly cut the horse’s
knees, and may pitch the occupant over the splash-board.
Let him hold well in, sit well back, play firmly and lightly
with his hand, ready to hold up sharply in event of a
stumble. Even a sure-footed horse may make a false step
from the pain of a loose, sharp-pointed bit of stone cutting
his frog. A judicious and timely support from the rein may
save the horse and preserve his balance, by thus suddenly
shifting part of the weight of his head and neck on to the
carriage itself.</p>

<p>Next to a powerful seat, the mouth of the horse and the
lightness of the hand upon it are the requisites. “Half the
value of a horse is in his mouth” is an old maxim. Few
owners are aware how much “manners” depend upon the
bitting and handling of a horse. Shifting the rein from one
bar to another makes all the difference in the going of the
horse. The mouth is the link of communication between
him and his driver; the bit must control him without fretting
him, and the touch of the hand, unless light, deadens
its own injunctions.</p>

<p>As the whip progresses in his craft, he will note many
other minor details, apart from mere safety, which conduce
to the welfare of his horse and carriage also. Though he is
bound by rules of road at rencontre, he may choose his own
path when all is clear; he need not take his share of rolling
into shape newly-laid stones, if a smoother passage presents
itself. Even if he can not altogether avoid stones, he may
yet ease the draught if he can manœuvre only one wheel
on to a smooth surface.—Cassell’s <i>Sports and Pastimes</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="EDUCATION_FOR_AND_AGAINST" id="EDUCATION_FOR_AND_AGAINST">EDUCATION FOR AND AGAINST
CASTE.</a></h2>

<p class='center'>By W. T. HARRIS.</p>


<p>We often hear in our time the fear expressed that there
is a danger in too much education, and especially in a too
great extension of free education at the expense of tax-payers.
“Where shall society obtain its hewers of wood
and its drawers of water?” is asked in an anxious tone. “Education
renders people unwilling to earn their living by
hand labor alone, and they resort to crime rather than work
at an honest trade.” Investigation, however, does not confirm
these fears. We find, upon studying social science,
that those states of the world that enforce universal education
are by far the greatest wealth producers and accumulators
of wealth.</p>

<p>The statistics of the seventeen states in our nation (the
seventeen that kept statistics of illiteracy in jails and prisons
in 1870), show that out of a total of 110,538 prisoners,
27,581, or 25 per cent. could not write, while only 3½ per
cent. of the adults of those seventeen states were illiterate—that
3½ per cent. of the population, if illiterate, furnish as
many criminals as 32 per cent. of the people, if able to read
and write—or that the one who can not read and write is
nine times as liable to get to prison as the one who can read
and write. Of course we must remember that the education
of the school is powerfully reinforced by the education of
the family, the community, the State, and the Church, and
that the school is not the only educational influence, nor
the most potent one. We must not place a too high estimate
on the phase of civilization that merely keeps men
out of prison. Chinese education does that, although it
does not produce scientific thinkers, a literature of freedom,
or a people that worship the true God, or any god that
allows man to participate in his being.</p>

<p>We shall learn this lesson again in studying the caste
education of India. The duties of each person to members
of his own caste and then to the members of the other
castes form the chief staple of Hindoo education. There
the hewers of wood and the drawers of water are effectually
provided for, first by birth and then by education.</p>

<p>If we desire to behold the effects of caste-education made
supreme over all others, we must look carefully into East
Indian life, and interpret it by its laws, religion, and philosophy.
The division of labor is necessary in order that
men may gain the requisite skill to conquer nature. Food,
clothing, and shelter are rendered necessary by nature—that
is to say, by our bodies—and can be supplied only by
nature—the mineral, vegetable, and animal realms. Besides
food, clothing, and shelter, there is the fourth want,
that of culture or spiritual direction, and the fifth want, or
that of protection,—the realm of religious and scientific education,
and the realm of the political government.</p>

<p>In India one caste is devoted to spiritual direction—the
Brahmin, which reads and interprets the Vedas and gives
counsel to the rulers of the state. Next is the Kshatrya,
or warrior caste, that manage the secular or political government,
with the counsel and advice of the Brahmins.
Then the food, clothing, and shelter providers, who devote
themselves to agriculture and the arts and trades of commerce,
form a third caste, the Vaisyas; and lastly is the
Sudra caste, which consists of day-laborers, or servants.
The caste is determined by birth, not by the free choice of
the individual, but by an accident of nature. For the East
Indian the division of labor is the great divine fact of life.
Brahma, the highest god, created the caste of Brahmins
from his head, the warriors from his arms, the trades peoples
from his loins, and the servants from his feet. Manu
says that the first part of the name of a Brahmin ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
express sanctity; of a warrior power; of a merchant wealth;
of a laborer contempt. The second part of the Brahmin’s
name should express blessing; of a warrior protection; of a
merchant means of subsistence; of a Sudra menial servitude.</p>

<p>Caste being of divine origin and imposed upon man, how
shall it be preserved and transmitted? The answer is a
perpetual education in the duties of one’s caste and in the
abnegation of all that looks toward the recognition of identity
of human nature and the equality of all in the substance
of manhood. The greatest possible care is taken not
to educate children beyond the position into which they are
born and which has been occupied by their ancestors (if
they belong to one of the regular castes). By marriage
other castes are produced. The Hindoo must have for his
first wife one of his own caste, and then he may take one
more from each caste below him. Thus the Brahmin may
have four wives, three being from the lower castes; the
warrior may have three wives and the merchant two, while
the Sudra can have only one. The children of the wives
from the lower castes are classified according to a scheme
invented by one of the kings, and there are more than thirty
castes in all. The chandalas have for their vocation the removal
of corpses, the execution of criminals, and such impure
offices. General duties, common to all castes, are very
few.</p>

<p>What is a virtue in one caste may be a sin in another.
The duties are prescribed with such minuteness that a very
complex system arises for each person, which must be
obeyed in its smallest particular, under penalty of excommunication
from one’s caste. The observances and formalities
are more numerous with the higher castes. Hence
even for the Brahmin, who is as a god to the other castes
there is such a weight of formalities and observances that
life is not worth living for him. He must perform tedious
ceremonies of purification to remove the effect of the most
casual accidents. Should he walk abroad and meet one
of a lower caste, he must turn back and purify himself. If
he should step over a rope to which a calf is tied, he must
purify himself. If he should happen to look up and see the
sun when setting, or at any time see it reflected in the
water, he must purify himself. If he should chance to go
out and get caught in a shower, he must purify himself; and
so, too, if he happens to step on the wrong foot when he
rises from bed. He must not look at his wife when she
sneezes or gapes or eats. He must not step on a cotton seed,
on a piece of broken crockery, or on ashes. When out in
the sun he must look northward; when under the stars,
southward; only when under a tree or a roof he may look
in any direction. If he should fail to purify himself he will
be excommunicated from his caste, and can be restored only
by a painful ceremony.</p>

<p>The first, second, and third castes are of the twice-born,
and they may hear the Vedas, but the Sudras must not read,
nor hear read, those holy books. Burning hot oil poured
into his ears was the penalty for breaking this law. If the
Sudra were to speak evil of a Brahmin or warrior or merchant,
the code of Manu decrees that a red-hot iron bar shall
be thrust into his mouth.</p>

<p>There is more respect shown toward cows than toward the
lowest caste of human beings. In fact, the Hindoo will not
tread upon ants nor kill brute animals, but founds hospitals
for sick or aged cows and monkeys, while he is entirely indifferent
to the sufferings of a man from a lower caste.</p>

<p>The women, even of the highest caste, are treated like
lower castes in spiritual things,—no woman is allowed to
read the Vedas or to become learned. The children of
whatever caste, too, may be sacrificed to the deities by
their parents. A mother may throw her child, especially
if it be a girl, into the Ganges, or any sacred river. The
women are excluded from education, and are given in
marriage in their seventh or eighth year. A woman who
is discovered to possess a knowledge of reading and writing
draws down upon her head the most severe condemnation.
There is one exception to this in the dancing girls,
and the bayaderes, who are purchased from poor parents
for service at the temples. These are taught by the priests
reading and writing, music, dancing, and singing, as well
as the female arts of coquetry. They are dedicated to
the gods, and do not learn housework.</p>

<p>Although the warrior caste and merchant caste may read
the Vedas, they must do it under the supervision of the
Brahmins.</p>

<p>Elementary instruction to the regenerated, or twice born,
includes reading, writing, and arithmetic. The children
learn to form letters on the sand first, and afterward on
palm leaves with an iron pencil; at last with ink on plantain
leaves. The monitorial system is practiced—one child
hearing the other recite his lesson and assisting him to
learn it. The Brahmin’s children are in all cases treated
with partiality.</p>

<p>The chief branch of study in school is, of course, the Vedas,
or holy books. This exercise must be approached with due
ceremony—of girding with bands, purification, consecrated
fires, and solemn ceremonies performed morning, noon,
and night. The pupil must seize his teacher’s feet before
he begins, and then read with clasped hands, and at the
close of his reading again seize his master’s feet. This ceremony
of greeting his teacher he performs by crossing his
hands and taking his master’s right foot in his right hand
and the left foot in his left hand.</p>

<p>Pupils generally reside with their teachers—in a sort of
boarding-school—each teacher having the care of ten or
twelve pupils. A very strict surveillance is kept up.</p>

<p>“Without his teacher the pupil must not enter a house
nor look to the right or left, but bend his look to the ground
as he follows behind his teacher.” “When reading the
holy scriptures one must not cough nor take any food or
drink. In blowing the nose one must not make too much
noise—nor spit in a clean place—nor offer tea with his
hand—he must hold his arm-sleeve before his mouth when
he gapes—he must not smack his lips when he eats nor
scratch his head.” Such directions are found in the educational
code. We often find sublime moral duties intermingled
with trivial details of ceremonial. If the pupil
does not say “<i>Om</i>” on beginning and ending his reading of
the Vedas, the exercise will do him no good.</p>

<p>The moral maxims are taught in the form of fables. The
book used is what we know as the Fables of Bidpai (“Friend
of Science”) from an Indian work, which was rewritten as
the <i>Hitopadesa</i> (“Friendly Advice”) some centuries ago.
It contains profound ethical wisdom, mixed with some
things whimsical and absurd. Proverbs are quoted at every
turn, being strung on the thread of the fable, like glittering
stones on a necklace.</p>

<p>The instruction of the Brahmin’s son extended to the philosophic
doctrines of Hindoo pantheism. To understand the
nature of this pantheism is most important. There is
Brahm—above all the individual gods. Brahm expresses
pure abstraction from all distinctions—merely to think it is
to become unconscious of all things. Brahma is the personification
of that substance (Brahm) as the creator,
Vishnu as the preserver, and Siva as the destroyer. Below
these high gods there are terrestrial ones presided over by
Indra, the Hindoo Jupiter, ruler of the sky. Creation is
not an act of the will of deity, but a sort of emanation “like
the growth of plants from seed or the hair from the head.”
The world proceeds from nothingness, growing out of
Brahma, and returns into nothingness—it is all an illusion,
a sort of dream, which the Hindoo calls “Maya.” Brahm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
is the substance of all the gods, and of the beings of the
world, and hence all their differences vanish to the Brahmin,
who meditates long enough to reach the idea of Brahm.
Hence the highest aim of education is to reach this annihilation
of all distinction—passing beyond all the gods, even
to Brahm.</p>

<p>The Sankhya philosophy expresses this doctrine of annihilation
of all particular things and beings through reflection:
“So through the study of principles the conclusive, incontrovertible,
one only knowledge, is attained, that neither I
am nor is aught mine, nor do I exist.”</p>

<p>One must not suppose that the Hindoo education is so
complete that the lower castes remain without aspiration.
They learn by degrees in what rests the power of the Brahmin
to ascend above the gods by the exercise of meditation
and abstraction. This is taught in the Bhagavad Gita—even
a Sudra can by meditation come to Brahm.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> The lower
castes may become partakers of the divine life through regeneration—“immense
self-denial, torture and penance” are
requisite. They become “yogis,” and undertake some
painful exercise, such as standing for twelve years without
once lying down, then clasping the hands over the head for
another twelve years; then a third grade by standing between
four fires and the tropical sun, afterward swinging
backward and forward over a fire for nearly four hours;
lastly, if life is not extinct, being buried alive for the same
length of time. If he lives still, the devotee has now become
a Brahmin.</p>

<p>From the bondage of caste there is therefore one possible escape—through
self-torture and penance,—but the remedy is
as bad as the disease. It was Buddha who taught a doctrine
that furnished a real relief from all this in the utter abolition
of the caste system. Driven out of India, this doctrine
spread throughout Ceylon, Farther India, China, Thibet, and
among the Tartars of Siberia, and to this day numbers
more human beings in its faith than any other form of religion.
It gives all families a chance to ascend to the highest
state of religious culture.</p>

<p>Buddhistic emancipation is from the rigid bonds of
family as well as from caste. Any family having four sons
must devote one to a monastic life. This demands the renunciation
of all personal wishes and longings—all desires,
all pride, and anger, and stubbornness; then the devotee
reaches Nirvana and all will and consciousness have sunk
into the rest and quiet of non-existence, and are purified of
all finitude and special existence. In Nirvana ceases all
change—no more beginning and ending—no more birth
and death—perfect rest.</p>

<p>In the catechism of Chinese Buddhism there are ten duties
prescribed: (1) Slay no living being; (2) steal not; (3)
be chaste; (4) speak nothing wrong; (5) drink nothing intoxicating—these
are also found in primitive Buddhism—another
five duties are added relating to external rules of
the order: (6) Do not perfume the hair on the top of the
head, nor paint the body; (7) do not listen to songs nor attend
the theater; (8) do not sit or lie on a large cushion or
pillow; (9) do not eat except at meal-time; (10) do not own
gold or silver, or anything of value as private property.
The ideal is that of mendicancy—pious beggary.</p>

<p>Its ideal of the divine is no higher than that of India.
God is conceived, not as a personal being having consciousness
and will and love (our Christian conception), but
rather as a being above personality and consciousness (the
Hindoo conception). Hence the Buddhist still strives for
the annihilation or extinction of his conscious individuality,
just as the Indian devotee, but without those frightful
penances, and without cruel laws of caste.</p>

<p>We can not commend the views of those who find in
Buddhism, as portrayed in the “Light of Asia,” a doctrine
almost or quite equal to Christianity. To us it seems to be
infinitely below Christianity. Its conception of God and of
God’s creation is just the opposite of the Christian conception,
for in Christianity we believe God to be a personal being,
who reveals himself in nature and man, and even becomes
human in his Son, and dies on a cross out of love for
the human race. Man can grow forever into the image of
God, realizing that image in his will, his love, his intellect,
because God is all there in an infinite degree, while to the
Buddhist God is none of these but a being who is the negative
of nature and of man too. Hence the education of
Brahminism and Buddhism is based on an idea radically opposed
to our own.</p>

<p>The ancients were acquainted with the loadstone, but
they only knew that it possessed the power of attracting
iron, whether it was that they attached little value to a
mere object of curiosity which led to nothing, or whether
they had never examined this stone with sufficient care.
A single experiment more would have taught them that it
turns of itself toward the poles of the earth, and would have
put into their hands the invaluable treasure of the mariner’s
compass. They were on the very verge of this important
discovery, but it escaped their notice; and if they had
given a little more time to what appeared a useless curiosity,
its hidden application would have been found out.—<i>Fontenelle.</i></p>

<h2><a name="ROUMANIAN_PEASANTS_AND" id="ROUMANIAN_PEASANTS_AND">ROUMANIAN PEASANTS AND
THEIR SONGS.</a></h2>

<p class='center'>By C. F. KEARY.</p>


<p>A special interest, as it seems to me, belongs to every attempt
to restore to a place in literature the genuine peasant
speech of the Roumanians, with all its Slavisms undiluted,
and showing by those Slavisms that it is not a sham peasant
literature with the thoughts of educated men put into
the language of a lower class. The task of contributing to
this restoration has been undertaken by M. Ricard Torceanu.
He has spent much time and labor in going from
village to village to collect the songs, the customs, and lore
of the peasants. Everything which he amassed was orally
communicated to him. What he gained was often
fragmentary and uncouth, but it had the advantage of being
a genuine product. It would almost seem as if the villagers
were beginning to forget their village songs. In a few years’
time, perhaps, these songs will be no longer to be heard,
having been driven away by the new education code and by
the new language which has been to a great extent substituted
for the old tongue. Then these poems will remain like
the last echoes of bygone days.</p>

<p>M. Torceanu has invented nothing, he has extenuated
nothing. He has set down what he heard, and no more; he
needs, therefore, to make no apology, although the poetry is
often meagre and is always absolutely simple. In actual
form these songs have some points of likeness to Mr. Barnes’s
Dorset lays. In both the beat of four is much the most
usual measure of the line; only that, owing to the difference
in the accent, while in English the four-beat is often
reached in only seven syllables, in the Roumanian eight are
nearly always employed. A great variety of accentuation
prevents the monotony which would naturally arise from
the frequency of this form. And as this variety of accent
can not be rendered in the English translation, more freedom
has been used in the number of syllables contained in
a line than is used in the original. At the same time the
four-beat, when found in the original, has been generally
preserved.</p>

<p>Alternate rhyme is the exception, the most usual thing
being the couplet. Very frequently, however, four of five
lines rhyme or sound together. These poets are not very
particular about accurate rhyme. Untrained ears are never
very exacting on this head. Our ballad literature could
show countless instances of such assonance as <i>wind</i>, <i>begin</i>,
<i>him</i>, <i>them</i>, <i>am</i>, <i>man</i>, etc. The Roumanians are much more
liberal still—at least as appears to our ears. Some of their
rhymes recall the loose assonance of old French poetry, such
as the <i>Chansons de Geste</i>. Little distinction seems to be
made between the liquids <i>l</i> and <i>r</i>, so that <i>are</i> and <i>ale</i> would
pass for a proper rhyme. In singing each line is repeated
twice, with a variety of accent.</p>

<p>The songs have one peculiarity: almost all begin with the
words <i>frunză verde</i>, that is, green leaf. To this follows sometimes
“of the so and so.” This reminds us of the beginnings
of the snatches of rhyme in Mr. Browning’s “Fra Lippo
Lippi”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 7em;">Flower o’ the clove,</span></div>
<div class="verse">All the Latin I construe is <i>amo</i>, I love.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Occasionally the <i>frunză verde</i> is followed on by the name
of a flower unconnected with it by any conjunction. Thus
the following song begins with a line which, literally translated,
is simply “green leaf, three violets;” but to make it
intelligible we will borrow the form from Mr. Browning’s
songs.</p>

<p>The same phrase <i>frunză verde</i> is frequently introduced
into the middle of the poem. One might be tempted to suppose
that when it is found there, it has been the result of the
welding together of two different songs. But there are some
instances where this certainly has not been the case.</p>

<p>Now take for a specimen the following song, characteristic
enough of the greater number of these village lays:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Green leaf, green leaf of the violet,</div>
<div class="verse">As of old, across the wold</div>
<div class="verse">And round my house the wind sobs yet,</div>
<div class="verse">Whispering longing and regret,</div>
<div class="verse">For the loved ones who have fled.</div>
<div class="verse">Breathes the wind among the grasses:</div>
<div class="verse">I faint with wishing as it passes.</div>
<div class="verse">Storm-gusts rise and fall again,</div>
<div class="verse">And passion wrings my heart with pain.</div>
<div class="verse">Breathes the wind, and small leaves move,</div>
<div class="verse">I die with longing for my love.</div>
<div class="verse">Over the mountain the mountain wind blows,</div>
<div class="verse">My longing for my kindred grows.</div>
<div class="verse">Blows the breeze the trees among,</div>
<div class="verse">My brothers’ names shall fill my song.</div>
<div class="verse">When it creeps the flowers through,</div>
<div class="verse">My sisters sweet I think of you.</div>
<div class="verse">Leaf o’ the maple branching fair,</div>
<div class="verse">What cloud comes here, the wanderer—</div>
<div class="verse">Hast thou told to her forsaken</div>
<div class="verse">How her love’s for a conscript taken?</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, little cloud, thou dost not carry</div>
<div class="verse">Rain or snow, but the tears of Marie.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Curious little conceits such as these, drawn from the common
imagery of nature, are very characteristic of the poems.
In that respect some of the songs resemble not a little
some of the popular songs which one may hear in Italy, and
resemble much less the popular songs of northern lands,
wherein these conceits are more rare. Here is a still more
simple fragment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Green leaf of holly, all are gone,</div>
<div class="verse">The girls of the village, and I am alone.—</div>
<div class="verse">Not all; for one remains for me;</div>
<div class="verse">Only one my hope to be.</div>
<div class="verse">My hope but she;—</div>
<div class="verse">Frail as ice my trust will find her,</div>
<div class="verse">To the trysting who can bind her?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class='unindent'>And here one which is far from ungraceful:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Undo, my dear, the charm which you have made,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And let me now go free.”</span></div>
<div class="verse">“To make you go my charm was never laid,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">But to make you marry me.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The following might seem like an imitation of Shakspere;
but it is a quite true rendering from the mouth of peasants to
whom Shakspere was not even a name:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Green leaf of the poplar grove,</div>
<div class="verse">Tell me, prythee, whence comes love?</div>
<div class="verse">From the eyes or from the brows,</div>
<div class="verse">Or from the crimson lips?</div>
<div class="verse">Can a peasant taste thereof</div>
<div class="verse">As one honey sips?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This is the lament put into the mouth of a girl who has
disgraced herself so far as to marry a tzigan (gipsy).</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Swallows, swallows, little sisters—</div>
<div class="verse">Sisters, seek my mother dear;</div>
<div class="verse">Tell her from her daughter here,</div>
<div class="verse">That she send her kirtle red,</div>
<div class="verse">For a raven she has wed,</div>
<div class="verse">And a large thick veil for shroud</div>
<div class="verse">When the watch-dogs bark aloud.</div>
<div class="verse">Her brave dresses, that she take them,</div>
<div class="verse">Into one rude bundle make them,</div>
<div class="verse">Throw them in the street and burn them,</div>
<div class="verse">Utterly to ashes turn them.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Or here again a woman’s complaint:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">When the world despises me,</div>
<div class="verse">Only God has any pity.</div>
<div class="verse">Thou too, doubting, comest not near me,</div>
<div class="verse">Willst not know and willst not hear me.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>Only one, my little dove,</div>
<div class="verse">Knew my sorrow, brought me love:</div>
<div class="verse">My sweet turtle dove, I know,</div>
<div class="verse">If her other half should go,</div>
<div class="verse">Would not mate with any other,</div>
<div class="verse">Or fly from one tree to another.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This is a more passionate vein, with some adumbrations
of a story in it:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Hide, O God, the moon in a mist,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Let me revel as I list;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Wrap like a shroud his face in a cloud,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Till my lover has kissed and kissed.”—</span></div>
<div class="verse">“Green leaf of the vine’s long train,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I go, but in autumn shall come again.”—</span></div>
<div class="verse">“If you go for a month away,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Mad you’ll find me on your home-coming day;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If you go away for a year,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Not mad you’ll find me but laid on my bier.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then to my grave I bid you come,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Scatter dust upon my tomb,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Take a look within</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">At the death of sin;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As I lie at your feet</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And at Death’s deceit.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Most of the poems collected are short ones, of a kind not
dissimilar from the specimens given above. There are,
however, some pieces which approach more nearly to the
ballad form, which are considerably longer, and contain
some sort of story. Our specimens would not be representative
unless we included one poem of this kind. Let this
ballad stand upon its own merits, merely as a representative
one, without attempting to explain or apologize for its
obscurities and want of harmony. The inequality of the
metre here will represent the, to our ears, irregularity of
the original:—</p>

    </div><div class="stanza">

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">I had once one beloved.</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fairer than any other.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">His eyebrows black as a raven’s wing,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">In an arch long drawn as is a ring,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Skin soft as silk, white as the froth of milk,</span></div>

<p>Whether this is anything more than a fragment one may
reasonably doubt, but no more than this was known to the
reciter. This is of course the disadvantage of orally imparted
poems, that a great portion is very often left out of
the beginning, the end, or the middle. Sometimes, again,
two different songs are combined into one. We can understand
without much difficulty what was meant by sending
the moon with a letter or message, and sending back the
sun; it is not so obvious what the letter written upon the
hazel-nut leaf implies. The explanation which seems the
most probable is: This Roumanian peasant lover could not
write. He had no means of sending a message unless the
sun would be the messenger, nor of receiving a reply unless
the moon would bring it. The peasants sometimes make
calls by whistling against a leaf, as our peasant boys do
with a piece of grass. This apparently is what is meant by
the answer sent by a hazel-nut leaf. Possibly the rest of
the poem, if there had been a remaining part, would have
made the difficult points of this ballad more clear. We
might have had a tragedy of the Ugo and Parisina sort.
But all that is now covered up in night.</p>

<p>With one poem of a simple kind we will end this short
selection:</p>

<h2><a name="HOME_LIFE_IN_GERMANY" id="HOME_LIFE_IN_GERMANY">HOME LIFE IN GERMANY.</a></h2>


<p>Housekeeping in Germany is reduced to a science; an accurate
knowledge of principles, gained by experiment, experience
and reflection. Personal and domestic expenditures
are regulated in strict accordance with the best theories
in consumption of capital and consumption of labor.
This is especially true in the large cities where the houses
are built to accommodate eight or ten families in addition,
various people below in the basements, such as shoemakers,
seamstresses, and washerwomen, who are ready to give service
to the <i>herrschaften</i> above. These houses are generally
built of brick, stuccoed, and oftentimes in the early
years of their existence present a very handsome front, deceiving
a stranger’s eye with the impression that they are
stone. The massive front door opening to the corridor
which leads to the <i>porte-cochère</i>, is in modern houses, most
ornamental. Wrought iron, in arabesque patterns, with
the monogram of the owner, serves to protect the plate-glass
behind. The panels of wood below are elaborately
carved. This door opens to the touch of a bell attached to a
rubber tube and bell which remains in the basement where
the <i>portier</i> lives. Invariably on the inside of the door one
sees in large German letters, “<i>Bitte die Thür leise zu zumachen</i>.”
Every person entering or going out reads this request,
and, while occupied with reading, naturally lets the
door slam the louder. Only sly young men returning from
the <i>kneipe</i> in the darkness feel obliged to bear it in mind.
The slamming of the great corridor door, however, makes
no impression upon the numerous families above, and if it
chanced to be a friend of Frau Schültze who just entered
the house, there is yet time for the gracious lady (<i>gnädige
frau</i>), who probably lives up the second flight of stairs, to
take off her morning cap (which a German woman is apt to
wear until she hears some one coming) before her friend has
time to ring the bell to her own apartment.</p>

<p>On each floor in the largest houses are two apartments,
usually of seven or eight rooms—large enough, the Germans
think, to accommodate a family of eight or nine. And if
you are a foreigner, examining these houses with a view to
renting, the <i>portier frau</i> will accompany you around, exclaiming
how comfortable it all is! There is a <i>salon</i> in the
front, a large, finely-proportioned drawing-room, with bay-window
and frescoed ceiling, and inlaid floor. Then the
smaller room to the right, or left, as it may chance to be,
looking also on the street with two windows, and generally
a balcony, is intended for the library or sitting-room. Then
throwing the folding-doors wide open, between the <i>salon</i>
and dining-room, she explains how handsome the two
rooms look during a dinner party. The dining-room has an
alcove with a large window looking down into the court.
Then you follow her through a narrow hall, passing perhaps
the bath-room, with the servants’ room above—only five
feet high—coming next to the kitchen. “But the bed-rooms,
where are they?” you ask, not being able longer to
suppress your anxiety on this point. “<i>Ach, hier sind die!</i>”
exclaims the astonished <i>frau</i>, and opens the door to two
small rooms, about 10x12. You look at your companion,
the significant glance is returned and you start for the next
house, or up a second flight of the same, to see if the division
of rooms be there as ridiculous. After visiting about
twenty-five houses, however, and finding them all alike,
you conclude a bed-room with a German is a secondary
consideration, and as to “guest chambers,” they have never
dreamed of them! Goethe was a true German in this respect,
and no wiser than the rest of his countrymen. Lewis,
in his biography of Goethe, never fails to express astonishment
at the small, dark room, in which the great man slept
and finally died. In the handsome old house at Weimar
the spacious reception rooms and commodious dining-room
contrast strangely with the dark little closet which is called
the bed-room. I heard a German gentleman, who came to
America at the time Mr. Schurz did, but who was not so successful,
and who returned to Germany, and was consequently
embittered with everything, say, “The Berlin
houses remind me, with their swell fronts and elegant
drawing-rooms, of the fashion of wearing embroidered
chemisettes when the rest of the toilet is mean and contemptible.”
“The Germans,” said he, “put all the elegance
on the front of their houses, while the sleeping-rooms are
miserably ventilated little holes.” This does not apply to
the houses built recently. There is no longer such discrepancy
between bed-room and <i>salon</i>—economy, convenience
and rich designing characterize many German houses now,
which would have astonished the German mind a half-century
ago.</p>

<p>The system by which these houses are rented or occupied
is worth our attention, since it has come to be a matter of
great expense for one family to rent or own a single house
in our large cities. Let us suppose the man who owns an
apartment house in a large German city to have a capital of
$60,000 invested. He lives himself with his family in the
<i>parterre wohnung</i>, or what we would call the first floor.
The <i>bel étage</i>, or second floor, is the choice apartment, and
rents, if the house be in a desirable part of the city, for 3,000
marks (a mark equals 25 or 24 cents). If the house be a
double one, and this is generally the case, the first <i>étage</i>
would bring 6,000 marks, the second <i>étage</i> 4,800 marks, and
the third <i>étage</i> 3,600. He has also his own apartment, and
below, the shoemaker, furnishes shoes for the family; the
seamstress does the sewing and the washerwoman is the
family laundress. From his capital he realizes a large percentage.
The taxes are heavy, but the outlays are not
great, being in most cases incidental, for the water, gas, and
garbage, etc., are met by the different tenants.</p>

<p>As to the housekeeping in one of these apartments or
<i>wohnungs</i>—the windows are casement style, with double
glass, easy for washing but difficult for drapery. The floors
are inlaid with different colored woods, and waxed. The
walls are papered with rich and dark colors, and the ceilings
finished in stucco. A characteristic German house will
be furnished about as follows: Grand piano in the drawing-room
or upright if preferred; in front of the sofa, a good
imitation of Smyrna rug, (made in Silesia generally). A
table stands on the rug removed from the sofa only far
enough to allow a stout matron to squeeze in for a seat in
one corner, which is her prerogative. Around the sofa are
arranged a half dozen chairs, all belonging in color and
form to the sofa. It would be unjust here not to say that
the modern craze for bric-a-brac, for elegant hangings and
unique furniture has penetrated the German mind as it has
the English and American, and the revival of house decoration
is appreciated in Germany by those who have the
means to investigate the subject, but the house we describe
is “pre-æsthetical” and stands for characteristic German
taste, and it will be found compares most favorably with an
American house before the “highly æsthetical” fever developed.
The dress circle of Smyrna rug, sofa, table and
chairs, is the center of attraction, but the opposite walls
and the corners of the room are not neglected. The piano
occupies a conspicuous position, and one or two pedestals,
with choice copies from the antique, are hid in the corners.
A lady’s writing desk, with delicate note paper ready for
her use, a beautiful chair for her service, and a rich robe
for her feet, completes a German lady’s drawing room. If
she can not afford good pictures, she will have none. Steel
engravings from the old masters are frequently found, but
seldom oil paintings unless the parties be very wealthy or
where artistic home talent prevails. How shocking many
houses in America are made, by horrid crude pictures—in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
color, houses which maintain some beauty in wood work,
carpets, walls, and furniture. The portfolio of etchings
which are now sent to the farthest west and all over the
United States for inspection, are creating a higher taste,
and it is a laudable scheme, although accompanied with
exorbitant prices.</p>

<p>The arrangement of our Teutonic lady’s drawing-room
is so national that the palace and the poor man’s house
has the same link of resemblance; for if a man owns but one
table and one sofa, the table will stand in front of the sofa,
and the chairs around it. This impresses a foreigner as being
stupid and dull, and the American or French or English
woman living in Germany conscientiously avoids all proximity
of sofas and tables. There is some excuse for this
stupid regularity in the circles which still have the <i>kaffee
klatsch;</i> an old and artless entertainment which traveled
women eschew, and women of high rank long ago ignored,
but which remains a blessing to women of moderate means
and unpretentious life. The hour for the <i>kaffee klatsch</i> is
always 4 o’clock, and each guest is requested to bring her
knitting or fancy work, to take her seat at a table spread
with a white cloth, upon which the <i>kaffee</i> stands, covered up
with a quilted hood to keep it warm, and flanked on either
side by large baskets of cakes. Here these innocent women
sit for hours sipping coffee and knitting and gossiping to
their hearts’ content. It is the hour <i>sans-souci</i> for the genuine
“<i>hausfrau</i>.” In such society one can recognize the
simplicity and ingenuousness of the German woman, and
contrast the startling differences of education and habit
with her American sisters.</p>

<p>Returning to the furniture of the house, we find the library,
or sitting-room (<i>wohnstube</i>), for private libraries are
rare, and only found in the house of the <i>gelehrte</i>. It is true
that every house has Goethe, Schiller, Wyland, Heine,
Schlegel’s translation of Shakspere, Humbolt’s travels,
and, it may chance to be, Kant, Hegel, and Strauss, if the
paternal mind cares no longer for Martin Luther. In the
neighborhood of the old <i>wartburg</i> the memory of Luther is
too sacred to allow David Strauss to lie on the same shelf
with the Reformer. If the family taste runs to æsthetics
more than ethics, a cabinet of rare porcelain will take the
place of a book-case in the sitting-room. But in either case
the inevitable sewing table stands by the window with an
easy chair by its side. If the gentleman of the house has
writing at home, or any business engagements, then the
sewing table finds its way to the big window in the alcove
of the dining-room. This room is more comfortable
than an American dining-room, inasmuch as it has, in addition
to the set of dining-room chairs, a sofa and some easy
seats, two closed cabinets for the damask, on either side of the
buffet, which glistens with glass and china. Sofa pillows
and footstools are abundant, which one can not say are easily
discovered in the American home. But first of all a German
house is comfortable, then ornamental. “Wine, wife
and song,” is the motto, as it was in the days of Martin
Luther, and <i>gemüthlich</i>, which may mean friendly, well-disposed,
good-natured, kind-hearted; snug, comfortable, lack-a-daisical,
is the word which expresses the tone of home
life. The bed-rooms are unattractive, as we have said. Two
mahogany bedsteads, side by side, “too short than that a
man can stretch himself on them, and the covering narrower
than that he can wrap himself in it.” These German
beds are fearfully and wonderfully made, feathers below
and above, pillows hid during the day under the covers,
and finally, a white spread thrown over the entire mountain,
in such a manner that it is impossible to distinguish
head from foot.</p>

<p>Of late the sense of the beautiful has brought to light in
the shop windows blue silk quilted spreads and lace coverings
for these monstrosities, and corresponding materials
for the toilet table. But the genuine <i>hausfrau</i> considers
them a “snare and delusion.” A German lady who had
just returned from a visit to America, said to me, “How do
the American women make up their beds? I must come
and learn. But,” added she, in the same breath, “I should
think you would die under such thin covers!” The floors of
the bed rooms are painted with yellow ochre and varnished.
Small rugs lie in front of each bed, and before each piece of
furniture. A candle, matches, and water <i>carafe</i> stand on
the table by the bed. During the Philadelphia Exposition,
a German, writing from an American hotel, observed:
“How exasperating it is to go to bed in a room with no
candle, only gas in the centre of the room, and innumerable
chairs between one and the gas at midnight; and how
dreadful to awaken and find white walls staring at one and reflecting
the morning sun into one’s eyes.” Just criticism!
The Germans are too highly cultivated in art to tolerate
white walls, and the Americans are rapidly becoming so.</p>

<p>The kitchen is the German woman’s pride, and no wonder,
with its shining rows of brass and copper kettles and
cooking utensils, hanging so orderly against the gray wall,
and the white porcelain oven, brass-doored and brass-knobbed.
Does it surprise you that she likes to take a seat
there every morning and talk over the <i>menu</i> for the day
with Frederika, then unlock the pantry door and survey
the clean shelves, all dressed up in perforated paper, or red
leather and brass tacks, and loaded with groceries and confectioneries.
What woman’s heart would not swell at the
sight of such a pantry and kitchen, and such a capable,
white-capped, white-aproned girl as Frederika? It is an
ideal picture, but one often and often seen in Germany.</p>

<p>We shall make the acquaintance of German servants
presently, but first some reference to the German ovens will
be necessary, for it is with these that the servant’s time is
first engaged in the morning and last at night. Next to
the Dutch stove, the German oven is probably the most
economical, and as far as mere temperature is concerned, the
most effective of all warming arrangements. They are built
of brick covered with porcelain and are part of the house,
being built in with the walls. The cost is about seventy-five
dollars for those finished with plain white tiles; but frequently
the tiles are colored like majolica, and are highly
decorated. In the Gewerbe Museum, of Berlin, there is a
collection of tiles used in Nürnberg on the old ovens—some
are most curious and beautiful. Since the spirit of decorative
art is reviving in Germany, as elsewhere, the artists of
highest rank do not consider it beneath their dignity to
paint tiles or panels, or anything that can ornament the
“house beautiful.” These ovens are generally built in the
corner of a room, and are oftentimes eleven feet high.
The fire is burned in a furnace near the bottom, and the
heated smoke is made repeatedly to traverse the structure
from side to side along the winding passage before it reaches
the top, where a pipe conveys it, when comparatively cold,
into a flue in the wall. The heated mass of brick continues
to warm the room long after the fuel is burned. The same
quantity of fuel which heats a German oven for a day is
consumed in an open grate in three hours. In Northern
Germany the poorer classes burn turf and charcoal, the
better classes use the turf to mix with the stone-coal.
Wagons of turf are brought to the front of the house early
in the morning, the horses unhitched and taken away. The
fuel is then carried basket by basket full, on the backs of
old women, to the attic or fifth story of the house, which is
divided into store rooms for the different <i>herrschaften</i>. On
this floor is stored the wood, the coal, the turf. Early in
the morning the back stairs are crowded with the various
servants, from the different apartments, going up and down
with their baskets of fuel. The fire must be lighted one
hour before the rooms become comfortable. While the fires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
are beginning to burn the waxed floors are being polished,
which is the time in our American or English economy for
cooking the breakfast. If our German friends however prefer
polished floors to gladden their sight on rising, to heavy
beefsteaks to warm their stomachs, what reason have we to
criticise? Frederika is lighting not the kitchen fire, but a
little spirit lamp underneath the “coffee machine,” or boiler,
and carrying in the fresh (but cold) rolls which she has just
received from the baker’s wife at the back door, and in ten
minutes she will formally announce to the <i>gnädigen herrn</i>
and the <i>gnädiger frau</i> (gracious lord and gracious lady)
that “<i>frühstück ist fertig</i>” (breakfast is ready). The <i>gnädiger
herr</i> will appear wrapped up in a heavy morning wrapper
(made of gray cloth, trimmed in mazarine blue) with
newspaper in hand, and the <i>gnädige frau</i> will take her
seat at the table where the coffee is sending up its smoke.
She looks, in her morning cap and white apron, surely as
healthy as her English sisters, and much more so than the
beautiful but frail American woman, who sits eating her
mutton chops and warm muffins. Who shall settle the
question if doctors disagree? Continental Europe has existed
on coffee and cold bread and eggs and never had dyspepsia,
while England and America have grown fat or
nervous on the beefsteak and muffins.</p>

<p>The German washing is so well-known, and has afforded
so much amusement, that I would not overthrow the traditions;
yet after a long residence in Germany, and an experience
of years in keeping house in a German apartment,
I learned to regard the “<i>grosse wäsche</i>” as a necessary development
of the apartment system of keeping house. For
instance, there is one common wash-room, and one drying-room;
the family in the <i>parterre wohnung</i> engage it the
first two days in the week, then it belongs to the family on
the opposite side of the house, and successively to the other
inmates of the house, so that weekly occupancy is out of
the question. But a foreigner can escape this egregious
imposition by sending the washing out of the house every
week and waiting patiently for it to return in ten days.</p>

<p>I was asked repeatedly by my German lady friends,
“Where is your wedding chest of linen?” meaning a carved
cedar chest containing a wedding dowry of linen, enough
to last through four generations, which is quite the thing
to be inspected by one’s intimate friends, more than the
<i>trousseau</i>. How should an American woman answer such
a question, or place herself in the favorable estimation of
her good German friends again after shocking their education
and hereditary taste by confessing that her house linen
was only sufficient for present use. There is a sense of
pride in the monthly washing in Germany little dreamed
of by the general observer.</p>

<p>A cook, a house-girl, or <i>kindermädchen</i>, and a man-servant
(<i>diener</i>) are the usual number of domestics employed
by a well-to-do German family where there are children.
If there are no children, a cook and <i>diener</i> are sufficient
help, even in a large city. In the country one girl is
enough. She is “Jack-of-all-trades,” and gets poor pay
and less praise for her proficiency. Her brawny arms and
rosy cheeks are only found admirable by some wandering
artist, who makes a hasty sketch of her carrying water from
the village fountain. Among people who keep up any
social style a <i>diener</i> in livery is indispensable. He opens
the door, serves at table, sets the table, polishes the floors,
does the errands, carries the invitation, walks behind the
ladies when they go out, or sits on the box with the coachman
when they are driving. Above all, he keeps Frederika
in a good humor by polishing the doors of her oven,
and sipping coffee with her while the <i>herrschaften</i> are sipping
theirs. She learns to call him her “<i>lieber Schatz</i>,”
and by and by, Frederika’s head becomes turned, and the
cooking is not so perfect. The wages of this <i>diener</i> are not
large according to American ideas; he receives, according to
his ability, per month, twenty thalers, ten thalers, five, or
even two and a half, if he is young, and has never served
outside a restaurant. In addition to his wages, he gets
good food, or the equivalent in money, which he generally
prefers, for he can then go to the <i>bier garten</i> and get his
meals, or eat with the family of the porter below. A servant
must understand his or her work distinctly before entering
into an engagement. Each must have a book in
which the employer can read the date of birth, place of
birth, the occupation of parents, the character of the employe,
the recommendation or condemnation of the last
employer. This book is kept by the lady of the house as
long as the servant remains in her service, and when leaving,
if the person has been faithful, she is expected to write
a good recommendation in the book. There are two classes
of cooks in Germany—the finished cook (<i>die fertige köchin</i>),
and the cook who is willing to do any kind of work. <i>Die
fertige köchin</i> is an educated queen in her department, and
like every autocrat, her power renders her unaccountable
for her actions. She prefers to do the marketing, and is in
league with all the grocers and butchers. This coalition of
butchers, bakers, grocers, and cooks in Germany is a confederacy
which threatens the <i>hausfrau</i>, the baroness and
royal household alike. Socialism is a ubiquitous monster,
and who feels it more than the helpless woman with her
account books before her, knowing there is no remedy if
the cook says “Meat has risen, and the butcher would not
take less.” An unending task in a European kitchen is
dish washing, for six dozen plates in serving the dinner
there go no farther than one dozen in the ordinary American
way. The <i>diener</i> is expected to help the cook in this
work, and once a week a <i>schauer frau</i> (scouring woman, or
woman inspector), comes to help. It is a distracting day
in the <i>wirthschaft</i>, and serves as a weekly reminder of what
is to come before Christmas and Easter. This <i>schauer frau</i>
comes early in the morning, tears down all the kitchen
utensils, takes off the brass oven doors, sets all the copper
kettles and tin ware in a row, and goes to work scouring
them as bright as we would think necessary for a spring
cleaning. Then she washes the windows, scrubs the floors,
and returns with her fifteen silver groschen in the evening
as contented as a woman in America would be with a
dollar. Christmas and Easter are the seasons above all
other times of the year for thorough cleaning. Then the
floors are so highly polished, and the brass knobs and doors
of the porcelain ovens made so brilliant that the servants
go around in felt slippers and old gloves, for fear of dimming
the luster before the dawn of the sacred days. Christmas
is an expensive season for the <i>herrschaften</i>—so many presents
expected: the cook, the <i>diener</i>, the porter and the
<i>portier frau</i>, the lamp lighter, the gas man, the butcher,
the baker, and candlestick-maker, and above all, the letter
carrier. Eight and five dollars are small amounts for the
cook and <i>diener</i>. But we must remember the cook’s small
wages during the year (from five to twelve dollars is the
usual monthly wages), before pronouncing the Christmas
gift too much.</p>

<p><i>Feiertage</i>, or holidays for servants in Germany, are a
great annoyance to the order of domestic life. They are so
importunant in their demands, and so obstinately disagreeable
if not gratified, that it is better for the family to go to
the restaurant for dinner and “eat bitter herbs where there
is peace,” than to remain at home for “a stalled ox,” with
angry servants to serve it. While they demand so much
for themselves, they are equally disappointed if the <i>herrschaften</i>
do not celebrate every birthday of their own. The
extra work is no consideration, and by touching little ways
they show their pleasure when extra company is expected.
Bouquets are placed on the coffee table by the plate of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
member of the family whose birthday has arrived; a cake,
with the number of candles to indicate the age of the person
is found burning, and Frederika and August have
broad smiles on their faces as they come in and rattle off
some poetry which they have committed to memory for the
occasion, wishing the person whose birthday they are celebrating
<i>glück</i> and <i>heil</i>.</p>

<p>Dinner parties are the most frequent and most formal entertainments
in Germany. They are stereotyped, but the
type belongs purely to Germany. When the ladies enter
the room, after the introductions they are invited to be
seated on the sofa and chairs of the “dress-circle” which we
have described. The gentlemen stand around the fair ones,
bending or breaking their backs in the effort to talk, or the
more unconcerned stand off in groups, learning from the
hostess at the earliest moment which ladies they are to
escort to the table. The seat on the sofa is the seat of honor,
and if a lady of inferior rank has arrived first and occupied
that place, she rises immediately and resigns it on seeing
her superior enter the room; so that a captain’s wife will
offer the seat to a major’s wife, and a major’s wife to a general’s
wife, and so on. The white-gloved <i>diener</i> throws
open the doors of the dining-room ten minutes after the arrival
of the guests, and the guests have the privilege of
speaking to each other at the table if an introduction has
failed in any case in the <i>salon</i>. The dinner is served entirely
from the buffet; the snowy damask, flowers and glass
are only presented upon the table for the guests to feast their
eyes upon. The meats are all carved in the kitchen, and
handed around by the servants. A good <i>menu</i> resembles
the French taste and order somewhat, although a discerning
eye will detect the German element in the following:</p>

<div class='center'>
Bouillon (consommé).<br />
Caviar (caviare).<br />
Lobster.<br />
Salmon du Rhin.<br />
Turbot d’Ostende.<br />
Poulets Santés aux Truffes.<br />
Pâté de Foie Gras.<br />
Filet de Bœuf Garni, Remouladen Sauce.<br />
</div>

</table></div>

<div class='center'>
Butter und Käse und Radieschen, mit Pumpernickel.<br />
Pudding d’Orange.<br />
Dessert.<br />
Café et Liqueurs.<br />
</div>

<p>There is much leisure, much conversation, and much
“toasting,” at a German dinner. Instead of the ladies retiring
when the cigars and coffee are served, as they do in
England, the gentlemen and ladies leave the table at the
same time, and upon entering the <i>salon</i> each guest goes to
the host and hostess and offers his or her hand, saying in
the most gracious manner, “<i>gesegnete malzeit</i>.” The guests
all shake hands with each other and repeat the same, and
then the gentlemen go into the library to smoke, and coffee
is taken to them, as it is also brought to the ladies in the
<i>salon</i>. The German hostess does not dress for her dinner
parties as much as the English women. She is never <i>décolleté</i>—generally
appears in light or black silk, square
neck and half sleeves, with long white gloves. When the
hour for departure comes, the <i>diener</i> goes down to the street
corner, orders a <i>droschke</i> (cab) for those who have not private
carriages, for one mark (twenty-five cents), the old
<i>kutcher</i> will drive away the happy or weary guest, and the
<i>diener</i> returns with a bright countenance and full pocket,
having received from each guest in the corridor below
enough “five silver <i>groschens</i>” to take Frederika to twenty
concerts, and buy as many glasses of beer as they want.
And so goes life in the “Vaterland!”</p>

<h2><a name="THE_VALUE_OF_GOOD_FOOD" id="THE_VALUE_OF_GOOD_FOOD">THE VALUE OF GOOD FOOD.</a></h2>


<p>The food which you give to your body keeps it for long
years unwasted and unworn, besides giving it the power by
which it works and moves. The food, to you, is maintenance
as well as strength. You do not destroy yourself by
the labor you get through.</p>

<p>The bread and meat which you eat, first get changed into
the substance of your body; actually become flesh and
blood; then as flesh and blood they perform a certain
amount of useful labor. Like the iron of the steam engine,
they are worn away by the work; but that is not of any
real consequence, because fresh food will make fresh flesh
and blood, capable of doing fresh work. You therefore are
fed, not only that you may be able to work, but also that
you may be kept in repair while you are working, at least
during some three-score years and ten.</p>

<p>The food first renews the worn body, and then it is the
renewed body which is worn again by work, yet again to
be renewed. Here, indeed, is a wonderful difference between
the divinely-planned mechanism and the mechanism
made by human hands.</p>

<p>Coal does something for the steam engine besides setting
it to work—it makes it warm. Soon after the fire has been
lit in the furnace, the iron gets furiously hot, and the water
in the boiler turns into scalding steam; all this heat really
comes out of the coal. It was hidden away in the black
mass, and only required that to be placed in the furnace, to
be set light to, and to be blown upon by a draught of air, in
order that it might be brought out and made serviceable.
One pound of coal has heat enough hidden away in it to
boil sixty pints of water.</p>

<p>But your body is too warm. And where do you think it
gets its heat from? Starve yourself for a day or two, and
you will find this out. You will, under such circumstances,
feel colder and colder, as well as getting weaker and weaker.
A good nourishing meal on the other hand, will directly
make you glow with warmth. Food warms the body, as it
furnishes it with strength. There is as much heat produced
in your body in a single year, as would be sufficient to turn
eleven tons of ice into steam; as much in a single day, as
would boil eighty pints of water.</p>

<p>Food, then, does three distinct things for the living body,
and the living body must be duly fed at proper intervals, in
order that three distinct ends may be gained. It keeps the
body warm. It maintains it in a state of repair, notwithstanding
the wear and tear to which it is exposed while laboring.
And it gives it strength and power. Weigh out
two pounds of bread and meat, and look at them. The two
pounds make no very great show. But eat them, and in the
wonderful contrivances of your body, those two pounds of
bread and meat will sustain its machinery unwasted during
the exertion of a fair day’s work, and in addition to this will
supply heat enough to make eighty pints of water boil, and
strength enough to lift a ton weight one mile!</p>

<p>In order that food may render these important services,
it is necessary that it shall be wisely chosen, and no less
wisely used. Many men get wasting disease and death out of
food, in the place of nourishment, warmth, and vigor. If we
were to heap up wet sand in the furnace of the steam engine,
instead of coal, fire would be smothered, and the movement
of the machinery stopped. If we were to heap up gunpowder
there, the whole would be blown into fragments in a moment.
Or so again, the fire of the furnace might be extinguished
by smothering it with too great an abundance of
coal; or it might be allowed to smoulder and die out for
want. Exactly in the same way the fire and strength of the
living body may be smothered by a too heavy load, or by a
bad kind of food. Or it may be fanned into the explosion of
destructive inflammation and fever. It is important, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
that everyone should know what right food is, and how
good food requires to be managed. When I go down to see
my friend’s yarn-spinning steam engine, I find that a very
great amount of care is bestowed upon its feeding. Only the
most suitable coal is supplied for its consumption, and the
stoker who feeds it is chosen from among his companion
workmen for his judgment, and he is trained to be exceedingly
careful, watching its wants, and studying its appetite,
so as to give exactly what it can manage, a little and often,
never allowing the furnace to be either too hungry or too
much gorged.</p>

<p>My friend is ten times more particular about the feeding
of his steam engine, than he is about the feeding of himself,
and in this respect he is pretty much like the rest of mankind.
Men select and regulate, with the most careful
thought, what they put into the furnaces of their machinery;
but into those delicate and sensible living furnaces which
they carry about in their own bodies, they toss with reckless
indifference, now, as it were, lumps of lead, and now explosive
gunpowder. There is, indeed, sad need that men should
be made more thoughtful than they are about feeding their
bodies. As a guardian and supporter of the health, good
food stands close by the side of fresh air and pure water.
Bad feeding, on the other hand, is the ally of foul air and
deficiency of water, in bringing about disorder. Improper
management in feeding, then, is another way in which men
lay up for themselves disease and suffering, and cause sickness
to take the place of health.</p>

<p>Man’s food consists of an almost endless variety of substances.
The surface of the earth is covered with things
which man can eat, and get strength out of. This is a very
bountiful arrangement, made by Divine Providence, in order
that the rapidly increasing multitudes of the human
race may be supported. Into whatever diversity of climate
or country man can go, there he finds a rich abundance of
the nourishment which the continued well-being of his
body requires. In the hot tropics he gathers bread-fruit
from the trees, and plucks rice from the ground. In temperate
lands he covers the soil with corn, and pastures beef-yielding
oxen and mutton-affording sheep upon the grass.
In the frozen wastes that lie near the poles, he gets whale-blubber
and seal-oil from the inhabitants of the ocean. The
water teems every where with fish, the air with fowl, and
the solid ground is literally painted green with fattening
grass. Nearly all food substances are, however, more or less
solid bodies, in order that they may be kept conveniently
in store until they are immediately needed, and it is, therefore,
a natural result of this arrangement that they have
to undergo a sort of preparation before they can be put
to use. The several parts of the body which have
to be nourished are far more delicate than the finest hairs.
Now suppose that you were set to get beef and bread into
hairs, I fancy you would find yourself rather puzzled by the
task. God however is not so puzzled. He pours beef and
bread into fibres that are as much smaller than hairs, as
hairs themselves are smaller than men six feet high and
three feet round. You will, no doubt, like to learn how this
is done.</p>

<p>The All-wise and Almighty Designer of life has seen fit
to employ in the work an agent that is already familiar to
us. This agent is pure water. God washes food into the
body, exactly as he washes worn-up material out of it. The
very water, indeed, which carries away the waste, has in the
first instance carried in the food. God has laid down pipes
of supply which run every where through the structures of
the body, exactly as he has laid down the drain-pipes. These
pipes branch out to the hair, the eyes, the head, the feet, the
flesh, the bones, and the skin. At the beginning of the supply
pipes there is a great pump always at work, pumping
on the supply. This pump is called the heart. Place your
hand on the left side of your chest, and you will feel how
this heart is springing at its pumping work. You will be
sensible that it is raising itself up at its labor, at every
stroke, so determined is the exertion of its strength. The
supply-pipes are termed arteries. One large arterial pipe
comes out from the heart, and then sends out branches in
all directions, very much like the water-pipes sent out
from the great reservoir into all the houses of a town. The
branch-pipes get smaller and smaller as they go from the
main, until at last they are many times smaller than the
smallest hair. The food that is washed through the branching
supply-pipes, by the strokes of the heart, is called blood.
There are about twenty pounds of blood in the body of a full
grown, active man; of these twenty pounds nearly sixteen
are nothing else than pure water, the other four pounds are
the finely divided food which is being hurried along by the
water. This then is what I mean when I say that the food
is washed into the body, by the agency of water. Take the
finest needle you can find, and stick its point any where into
your body, and you will find that blood will rush out of the
hole. This will show you what great care has been taken to
send supply-pipes everywhere. There is no spot, however
small, into which a needle point can be thrust without
wounding a supply-pipe. When the heart pumps, red blood
thus flushes through every portion of the living frame, repairing
and warming it, and supporting it in its offices.
But you will say I have not yet proved my case. Food is
washed out of the heart to all parts of the body. This heart,
however, is already in the body. There is therefore no
washing of the food into the body here. It is already in,
when it is pumped from the heart; but where does the heart
get the blood from, which it pumps onwards? How can it
be shown that the blood comes from the food? This is to
be my next step. I am going on to explain to you that the
heart gets its blood from the food which is eaten; that the
blood indeed is finely divided food given up to the carrying
power of water; food finely prepared for its task of nourishing
the living frame. How then is the food thus prepared?
how is solid food turned into liquid and easily flowing blood?</p>

<p>Food is turned into blood by being digested. Men have
digesting bags, more commonly known under the name of
stomachs, inside of them, into which portions of digestible
substances are placed from time to time. These inside digesting
bags are particularly convenient, because when a
fair quantity of food is once packed away there, men may
move about in pursuit of their business without having to
give any further heed to the digesting work that is going on
in their behoof. Before, however, food is passed down into
the digesting bag, it is first ground in a powerful mill, and
mixed up with liquid into a sort of paste. The mill has
many pairs of very hard stones set in rows over against each
other. It is called the <i>mouth</i>, and the stones are termed
<i>teeth</i>. The liquid, which makes the ground food into paste,
is poured out from little taps laid on in the mill or mouth,
and is called <i>the saliva</i>.</p>

<p>When the ground and moistened food has been deposited
in the stomach, more liquid is poured out upon it there.
This liquid is termed the “gastric” or <i>stomach juice</i>. Next
it is shaken, and churned up, and turned over by the movements
of the stomach-bag. After a few hours’ churning, it
has become so soft and pulpy from the soaking, that it is
ready to advance another stage. Then a sort of sluice-gate
at the end of the stomach is opened, and down the pulp
goes into the bowel, there to be mixed with another liquid
called <i>bile</i>, or <i>liver juice</i>, and the soaking or digestion is
completed. The pulp then consists of two things—a white
milk-like liquid; that is the rich and nourishing part of the
food, ground and soaked down to the utmost fineness, and
mingled with some of the water which has been drunk.
And a coarse solid substance, still undigested; that is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
waste part of the food which has resisted the dissolving
power of the stomach, and is on its way to be rejected as
good for nothing. The white milk-like essence of the food
gets sucked up, by a quantity of little holes or mouths that
lie all over the lining of the bowel, as the pulp moves down
this canal. Then it is carried by tubes provided for the
purpose into one main channel. This channel runs upwards
until it ends in the great forcing pump. Poured into the
heart, it reinforces the blood which it finds there, and is
sent onwards with it through the supply-pipes. This is
how food becomes blood.</p>

<p>But there are certain distinct and different principles
which the body requires should be furnished to it, out of
food. You stand there very firmly on the ground, and you
look jolly and substantial enough. I should think from
your appearance you have been in no way stinted in the
matter of supplies. I estimate, at a guess, that your substantial
body would weigh, some one hundred and fifty
pounds, if placed in the scales. Now what do you think
the greater part of those one hundred and fifty pounds is
composed of. Bones? Not exactly, you are too soft for
that. Flesh? There seems plenty of flesh, but the flesh is
not the most abundant element. Brains? I am afraid
they are less than the flesh. No. You will wonder indeed
when I tell you that three-quarters of that firm and well-knit
frame are nothing else but water. If I were to take
your body and dry it until all its water was gone, there
would remain behind nothing but thirty-seven pounds of
dry mummy-substance, in the place of the original one hundred
and fifty pounds; one hundred and thirteen pounds of
water would have steamed away. You will see then that
water must be furnished in fair quantity, with or in the
food. You have heard, I do not doubt, many horrible and
sad things which have happened when people have been
kept a long time without water. Thanks to the bounty
of Providence, this privation is, however, one that very
rarely occurs.</p>

<p>But now, supposing that we have steamed away the one
hundred and thirteen pounds of water, and that there
are left behind thirty-seven pounds of dry substance, what
does that substance consist of? It still contains several
distinct things, which have had entirely distinct offices to
perform in the living frame.</p>

<p>First, you know, there is that flesh, which makes so
comely a show. Now, we shall be able to find out how
much there really is of flesh. Of dry flesh-substance, including
a little skin and jelly, there are seventeen pounds,
and that is the working part of the frame. It is by its
means the ton-weight can be lifted one mile high in a single
day, and that all the moving and acting, of whatever kind,
are effected. Remember, then, that the acting part of the
living body is flesh-substance, and that of that flesh-substance
there are not more than seventeen pounds in a full-grown
man.</p>

<p>While your body is alive, there is a hard frame-work inside
of it, upon which the soft flesh is fixed, in order that it
may be kept in a convenient and durable form, and around
which the water is packed in a countless myriad of chambers,
and vessels, and porous fibres. The hard internal
frame-work is composed of what are called bones. In the
dried mummy, left when the moisture is all gone from the
body, there are rather more than nine pounds of this mineral
bone-substance. But there are also nearly three-quarters
of a pound of other mineral substances, which were
scattered about in various situations, and which were employed
for various purposes. There is salt which was in
the saliva, in the gristle, and in the blood. There is flint
which was in the hair. There is iron which was in the
blood. There is potash which was mixed with the flesh-substance.
There are lime and phosphorus in the hard
millstones—the teeth; and there is phosphorus, which was
in the nerves and the brain. These mineral substances
with the bone-earth, which is principally a kind of lime,
form together the ash or dust which is returned to the
ground after the body has decayed. It is the flesh-substance
which flies away to become poison-vapor in the
air.</p>

<p>But besides water to do transporting work, flesh substance
to do active mechanical or moving work, and mineral substance
to do passive mechanical or supporting work, there
is yet another kind of material within the body. You have
as much as six pounds of fat, scattered about or packed
away amid the seventeen pounds of dry flesh. What can
that be for? What use do you think you make of your fat?
You have, I dare say, a sort of comfortable sense that it
keeps you warm. You know that some of your lean neighbors
cast envious eyes towards you in severe winter weather,
and have chattering teeth and goose’s skins, when you are
quite free from such tokens of chilliness. But you will
nevertheless be surprised when I tell you what a really fiery
piece of business this warming by fat is. Your fat is a store
of fuel, which you are going to burn to heat your body, exactly
as you burn coal in the grate to heat your room in the
winter. It is oil laid by, to be consumed gradually, as a
sort of liquid coal, in the furnace of the living machine. Of
this, we shall, however, have to say more, by itself, by and
by. For the present merely bear in mind that fat is the fuel
substance which furnishes warmth to the body. It also
combines with the phosphorus and with water to make up
the nerve-substance and the brain-substance, which do the
feeling and thinking work. These too, however, will have
to be spoken of hereafter by themselves.</p>

<p>Let us now then take stock of the stores we have on hand,
within the skin of a living body of 150 pounds weight. We
have</p>

<p>As the blood is the direct source of supply to all the structures
of the body, the material which is being poured out
through the supply-pipes,—it follows that those four pounds
must contain within themselves flesh-substance, mineral
ash, and fuel. There are in twenty pounds of blood, sixteen
pounds of water to wash along the more substantial part
through the supply-pipes, three pounds ten ounces of flesh-substance,
four ounces of fuel, and about two ounces of
mineral matter; salt, phosphorus, lime, and the rest.</p>

<p>The blood is speedily exhausted of its richness, because it
gives up its several ingredients to the different parts of the
living frame to confer warmth, repair, and active strength
upon them. The warmth is procured by burning the fat;
you will easily understand that; you know that an oil lamp
gets very hot whilst its flame is kept up. The repair is
effected by the plastering of new matter out of the blood,
upon all the different structures as they wear away. Each
structure chooses for itself out of the blood what it wants,
and arranges what it takes in due order. But you would
now like to know how active strength is supplied by the
blood. It will not be possible just now to tell you concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
this, all which might be, and indeed ought to be told,
because we have other and more practical things to bend
our attention to. But this much you will easily comprehend.
The power comes out of that very change of substance,
which we call wear. The “wear” is actually the
turning of the substance into power. Upon another occasion
this may be made more plain.</p>

<p>The blood supplies what every part of the living body requires,
and of course itself loses what it gives out. But the
exhausted blood is in its turn renewed and refreshed by
occasional supplies of food. Here then we at last arrive at
the pith of the subject we are speaking of. The food supplies
the blood, and the blood supplies the body. Therefore
efficient and good food must have in it all the several principles
required by the body—flesh, fuel, and mineral. No
kind of food is sufficient to maintain vigorous life and
health, which does not contain a due amount of every one
of these.</p>

<p>When the young animal comes first into the world, its
powers of digestion are weak, and it is fed for some time entirely
upon a food already digested for it by the parent.
This parent-prepared food of the young animal, which is
called milk, of course contains within itself all the several
matters which have been spoken of above, as necessary for
the supply of the body. Thus when the dairy-maid curdles
milk with rennet, and draws off the whey, afterwards
pressing and drying the curdled part, the curd at length
comes out of the press as cheese. That is the flesh-substance
which was contained in the milk. When the dairy-maid
turns and twists cream about in the churn, until
butter collects in the midst of it—that butter is the fuel-substance,
or fat, which was contained in the milk. The
whey which is taken off from the cheese, or butter, is principally
water; but if this water were steamed away by
heat, there would remain behind a small quantity of fixed
ash, which could not escape. This is the mineral-substance.
Here then we have what we may term a specimen
of Nature’s pattern-food. The relative proportion in which
the several food-principles are contained in milk, becomes
most excellent guide to the way in which they should be
used in the more artificial feeding of later life. Take then as</p>


<p class='center'>A RECEIPT FOR PATTERN-FOOD,</p>

<p class='unindent'>the following, which expresses the relative quantities of
cheese, butter, and ash, in milk:</p>


<ul>
<li>One ounce of Flesh-substance,</li>
<li>Two ounces of Fuel-substance, and</li>
<li>Ninety grains of Mineral-substance,</li>
<li>To twenty-two ounces of Water.</li>
</ul>


<p>The most extensively and generally used of all the articles
of human diet is bread. It has been fittingly called
“the staff of life.” Now it is a curious and remarkable fact
that bread contains in itself just the same principles as
milk; but it is of course drier, and has proportionally more
fuel and less flesh-making substance. The flour, from
which it is made, is composed of a stiff, sticky paste, and a
fine white powder, well mixed up together. The paste is
flesh-substance; it is nearly the same thing, indeed, as the
flesh of the body, in all excepting arrangement. The powder
is starch: just such as is used in the work of the laundry.
Now starch is merely fat in its first stage of preparation.</p>

<p>When bread is well made, the rising of the dough marks
the change of the store-starch into sugar and gum through
fermentation. This is really a beginning of the work of digestion,
and, in so far, a lightening of the task the stomach
will have to perform. It is very important, however, that
this change shall be carried to a proper point, and then
stopped. Bread should be neither too heavy nor too light.
If the former, it will not be easy enough of digestion; if the
latter, some portion of the virtue will have been unnecessarily
wasted. Bread contains a great deal of water, and so to
a certain extent is both food and drink.</p>

<p>Brown bread is more rich in flesh-making substance, bulk
for bulk, than fine wheaten bread, because the outer husk
of the grain, which constitutes the bran, itself contains a
large quantity of that material. When the dough is formed
from whole meal, instead of fine flour, the cost of the bread is
considerably diminished, at the same time that its bulk and
weight are, even in a greater degree, increased.</p>

<p>Rye bread is not so pleasant in flavor as wheaten bread,
but it is about equal to it in nourishment, and can be kept
for months without being spoiled, which wheaten bread can
not. Oatmeal can not be fermented like wheaten meal, but
it is nearly as rich again in flesh-making substance. It is
its very richness in this gluey material, which renders it
incapable of being made into bread. Scotch men and women
consume a great quantity of oatmeal as porridge and
unfermented cake, and get both very fat and strong upon
their food. This article of diet has, indeed, the recommendation
of being very appropriate for young people, who are
growing rapidly, and is fortunately, at the same time, comparatively
cheap.</p>

<p>Milk, the pattern food, contains, it will be remembered,
twice as much fuel as flesh-substance in it. But the bread
contains eight times as much fuel as flesh-making substance.
Consequently a great deal more bread has to be consumed to
get the same amount of nourishment out of it, and then
very much more fuel has been taken into the frame than is
required, which has to be got rid of as waste. Hence it is
both economical and wise to add to a bread diet, whenever
this can be done, some other kind of food, which consists
principally of flesh-substance. Butter and fat are also advantageously
taken with it, because the fuel contained within
bread is a great deal of it still only store-fuel, and unfit to
undergo immediate burning.</p>

<p>The best addition that can be made to bread-diet is obviously
that flesh substance which is already in a very perfect
and condensed state—namely, Meat. Lean beef contains
four times as much flesh-substance, weight for weight, as
the most nutritious bread, and it is entirely destitute of the
store-fuel, starch, of which bread has such a superabundance.
Meat therefore is manifestly the natural ally of bread
in the formation of a very nutritious diet. All wild animals
have very little fat mixed with their flesh. It is, however,
the great object of the grazing farmer to make his mutton
and beef as fat as he can. Meat, as it is sent to market,
commonly has one-third of its substance fat alone. Such
meat approaches more nearly to the nature of bread, and
indeed may almost be used instead of it, so far as its influence
on the support and warming of the frame is concerned.</p>

<p>It is even more important how meat is cooked, than it is
how bread is made.</p>

<p>A pound of meat loses an ounce more in baking, and an
ounce and half more in roasting, than in boiling. Boiling is
therefore the most economical method of the three. Meat
should always be put first into boiling-hot water, because by
this means the pores of the surface are at once closed fast,
and the juices shut in. When meat is placed in cold water,
and kept gently simmering, the juices all ooze out into the
water. The latter plan is the best mode of proceeding, when
the object is to make nutritious soup or broth. But when
it is desired to keep the meat itself nutritious, the employment
of the greater heat first is the more judicious course.
So likewise in roasting, the meat should be placed at once
close before a clear fierce fire, in order that by the curdling
power of the heat a great coat may be formed upon it,
through which the juice cannot flow; then it should be removed
further away, in order that the inside may go on
cooking more gradually by the heat of the imprisoned juices.
When meat is placed before a dull, slow fire at the first, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
principal part of the gravy runs out, before the surface is
hardened and closed.</p>

<p>The great object of cooking is the reduction of the several
principles of the food into such a soluble state as will prepare
them to be easily acted upon by the digestive powers of
the stomach, at the same time that none of their virtue is
allowed to be lost. Cooking is, indeed, properly the first
stage of digestion; it is an art which the intelligence of man
has taught him, in order that food may be made to go as far
as possible in furnishing nourishment to living frames. By
good cooking, hosts of things are converted into excellent
nourishment, which would be entirely unmanageable by
the stomach without such assistance. The art of cookery
ought, however, never to be carried further than this. It
should not strive to make men eat more than their bodies
want, by furnishing the temptation of delicious flavors.
Every meal should have brought together into it a due admixture
of the several distinct principles, which have been
named as the great requirements of the body; but there
should be no greater degree of mixture than is just sufficient
to ensure this. There should be flesh-substance in a half-dissolving,
or tender stage. There should be a still larger
amount of fuel-substance, partly fat, and partly such as is
in a condition capable of being converted into fat in the
stomach and blood. Mineral substance enough is sure to
be present in every kind of food; and water, of course, can
be added in any amount, as drink.</p>

<p>The potato contains twelve times as much starch as
flesh-making substance; it is thus one-half less nutritious
than bread. On this account it is very generally made the
companion of meat.</p>

<p>It is of the very highest importance that any one who is
likely to ever have the care of a household, whether large
or small, should so far understand the objects of cooking
and the principles upon which the process requires to be
performed, as to be able to see that food is properly and
economically prepared. If your means be small, remember
that such knowledge can make that portion of your money
which is devoted to the purchase of food, go as far again,
and yield twice as much harmless gratification as it would
otherwise do; if you have an abundance of means, then the
knowledge may be made serviceable in providing only such
food as is suitable to the maintenance of health and strength,
and the avoidance of disease. If you have a family of children
to bring up, and have plenty of money to do it with,
you are perfectly right to furnish them with every accomplishment,
and every advantage learning confers; but
never forget that no woman is ever less accomplished because
she knows something about homely household concerns,—cooking
among them,—as well as a great deal concerning
other things.</p>

<p>Fish very nearly resembles lean meat in its character; it
is hence a very good companion to potatoes and bread. In
a general way it requires to be eaten with butter or oil on
account of its deficiency in this ingredient.</p>

<p>Fresh vegetables contain a very large proportion of water,
but there is in their structure also a considerable amount of
flesh-making substance, besides starch and sugar.</p>

<p>Fresh vegetables require, in most instances, to be boiled
before they are eaten, because their juices contain disagreeable
flavors, and in some instances unwholesome ingredients,
which are, however, entirely removed by the influence
of boiling water. Ripe fruits, on the other hand, are vegetable
substances, which have been thoroughly cooked by
the maturing powers of the sun, and which have also been
endowed, by the hand of Nature, with the most delicious
flavors, in order to tempt man to feed on them in due season;
they are, so to speak, bouquets provided for the
palate.</p>

<p>We have now to suppose that a wholesome but plain meal
of good bread, and well-cooked meat and vegetables, selected
and prepared according to the principles which have
been explained, is set before you, and that you are about to
apply these to their proper office of nourishing your body;
how will you proceed? You will introduce the food, morsel
after morsel, into your digesting bag. Now while you are
doing this, take care to bear in mind what you are about.
You are swallowing substances that will need to be brought
most thoroughly within the power of the saliva and stomach-juices,
in order that these may perform their wondrous dissolving
work. Do not, then, forget the mill. Those ivory
teeth have not been planted so firmly in your jaws for no
purpose. They are meant for work, and for hard work too.
Food is not intended to be bolted, but to be ground. Do not
furnish one single morsel with its pass until it has been reduced
to the finest pulp; then the saliva will get to every
grain of the store-starch, and change it into serviceable sugar
and gum, and the stomach-juice and liver-juice will get
to every fibre of the flesh-substance, and reduce it to milk-white
liquid, capable of entering the channels of the supply-pipes.
If you bolt, instead of thoroughly grinding your
food in the mill, be assured that the heavy lumps will prove
too much for your digesting bag, however strong that may
be. The greater portion, after having oppressed the offended
stomach with their unmanageable load, will cause
griping and all sorts of annoyance, and will at last be dismissed
from it, undissolved and without having furnished
any nourishment.</p>

<p>Another important thing is to get enough food if you can;
the body requires to be sufficiently nourished. On the other
hand, however, be very careful that you do not attempt
to get more than enough. If you do try to accomplish this
you will fail in the attempt, and have to pay a heavy penalty
for your failure. Thousands upon thousands of people
do try, and do fail, and then pay such penalties. You have
heard it said that enough is as good as a feast. This is only
a half-truth, it does not go sufficiently far. Enough is far
better than a feast, if “a feast,” means more than enough.
There is more danger really in over-feeding, than under-feeding.
Countless numbers of underfed countrymen work
through a long life in the fields, in happiness and contentment,
and arrive at old age, almost without an hour of illness.
But every overfed man sooner or later has to go to
bed, and send for the doctor to help him to get rid either of
rheumatism, or fever, or gout, or inflammation, which are
forms of disorder into which superfluous food often changes
itself. The life of labor and short commons, has upon the
whole a much larger share of happiness, than the life of
laziness and luxury.</p>

<p>But what is enough? That in regard to the feeding is a
very serious question. At the first glance, too, it seems to
be one which is not altogether easy to answer, because some
men require more food than others, just as some steam engines
consume more coal than others, to keep themselves
moving; and just as some lamps take more oil than others,
to keep up their flames. It is, nevertheless, a question
which may be very easily answered. Every man who eats
his meal slowly and deliberately,—not forgetting the mill,—has
had enough when his appetite is satisfied. Appetite
really is Nature’s own guard. It is ruled, not by the state
of the stomach, but by the condition of the blood. When so
much blood has been taken from the supply-pipes of your
body, by the working parts, that those pipes begin to be
comparatively empty, their emptiness makes itself felt in
your frame as hunger. Obedient to the hint, you find
up food and eat. But while you are eating what happens?
First you seize the food with all the keen relish of a hungry
man. Then as you eat on, the relish becomes less and less,
and if your meal be a simple one, when you have had
enough, all relish has disappeared, and the very things that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
tasted so deliciously at first, are insipid, so that you find no
farther enjoyment in the act of grinding and swallowing
them. Go on eating after this, and the insipidity will be transformed
into disgust; and if notwithstanding this you still
persevere in forcing food into your stomach, that sensible
organ will at last rebel against the tyranny, and return the
whole which it has received upon your hands. Then it will
be some little time before the stomach gets over the insult.
Consequently the blood remains all this while in the impoverished
state, and the result of the over-gorge is that the
body itself is actually starved, instead of being feasted. If
when your natural appetite for food is satisfied, and your
enjoyment and relish of it have ceased, you have rich and
high flavored dishes set before you, the high-flavors will
then still prove agreeable to the palate, and act upon it as a
sort of excitement, and the natural appetite will have its
work superseded by a false and artificial one, and you will
go on eating under this temptation, until your stomach is
over-crammed. All the so-called luxuries of cooking are
merely devices to make men eat more, who have already
eaten enough.</p>

<p>But when men who have already eaten enough, eat more,
what must happen? one of two things—either the stomach,
being particularly vigorous, will get through an extra amount
of work; then there will be more blood sent into the supply
pipes than the body requires, and the frame will be everywhere
stuffed and oppressed with the load, to the danger of
inflammations, rheumatism, and other like disorders being
set up: or the stomach will be unequal to the task of doing
extra work; then the food which can not be digested will
decay and putrify in the stomach and bowels, producing
there all sorts of poison vapors and disagreeable products,
which will lead to stomach and bowel disorders, until nature,
or the doctor, finds some way for their removal, or until
something worse takes place.</p>

<p>Thrice favored is he who is not daily exposed to the dangers
of a luxurious table. Money, after all, is not in itself a
blessing. It is only a blessing when it is possessed by those
who know how to employ it for good purposes. In the
hands of men who do not know how to employ it so, it
often proves to be a curse.</p>

<p>Food which is already in a state of commencing putrefaction
or decay, is always dangerous for this reason: it
forms poison vapors and injurious products in the stomach,
before its digestion can be completed in the natural way.
If, however, meat about to be used is at any time found to
be tainted, it will be at once rendered wholesome, if the
most tainted part be cut away, the cut part being rubbed
with a piece of charcoal, and the joint be then well boiled
in water, in which a piece of charcoal has been placed.</p>

<p>Here, then, in conclusion, are two or three golden rules
for the management of your feeding:</p>

<p>Never have any but the plainest and simplest food placed
before you when you are hungry, whether you be rich or
whether you be poor.</p>

<p>Eat of it until you find the relish for it disappearing.</p>

<p>There stop, and on no consideration swallow another
mouthful, until the sense of appetite and relish comes back
to you.</p>

<h2><a name="A_DREAM_AND_PRACTICAL_LIFE" id="A_DREAM_AND_PRACTICAL_LIFE">A DREAM, AND PRACTICAL LIFE.</a></h2>

<p class='center'>By GOETHE and ECKERMANN.</p>


<p><i>March 12, 1828.</i>—After I had quitted Goethe yesterday
evening, the important conversation I had carried on with
him remained constantly in my mind. The discourse had
also been upon the sea and sea air; and Goethe had expressed
the opinion that he considered all islanders and
inhabitants of the sea-shore in temperate climates far more
productive, and possessed of more active force, than the
people in the interior of large continents.</p>

<p>Whether or not it was that I had fallen asleep with these
thoughts, and with a certain longing for the inspiring
powers of the sea; suffice it to say, I had in the night the
following pleasant, and to me very remarkable dream:</p>

<p>I saw myself in an unknown region, amongst strange
men, thoroughly cheerful and happy. The most beautiful
summer day surrounded me in a charming scene, such as
might be witnessed somewhere on the shores of the
Mediterranean, in the south of Spain or France, or in the
neighborhood of Genoa. We had been drinking at noon
round a merry table, and I went with some others, rather
young people, to make another party for the afternoon.</p>

<p>We had loitered along through bushy and pleasant low
lands, when we suddenly found ourselves in the sea, upon
the smallest of islands, on a jutting rock, where there was
scarcely room for five or six men, and where one could not
stir for fear of slipping into the water. Behind us, whence
we had come, there was nothing to be seen but sea; but
before us lay the shore at about a quarter of an hour’s
distance, spread out most invitingly. The shore was in
some places flat, in others rocky and somewhat elevated;
and one might observe between green leaves and white
tents, a crowd of joyous men, in light-colored clothes, recreating
themselves with music, which sounded from the
tents. “There is nothing else to be done,” said one of us
to the other, “we must undress and swim over.” “It is
all very well to say so,” said I, “you are young, handsome
fellows, and good swimmers; but I swim badly, and I do
not possess a shape fine enough to appear, with pleasure
and comfort, before the strange people on shore.” “You
are a fool,” said one of the handsomest, “undress yourself,
give me your form, and you shall have mine.” At
these words I undressed myself quickly, and was soon in
the water, and immediately found myself in the body of
the other as a powerful swimmer. I soon reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
shore, and, naked, and dripping, stepped with the most
easy confidence amongst the men. I was happy in the
sensation of these fine limbs; my deportment was unconstrained,
and I at once became intimate with the strangers,
at a table before an arbor, where there was a great deal
of mirth. My comrades had now reached land one by one,
and had joined us, and the only one missing was the youth
with my form, in whose limbs I found myself so comfortable.
At last he also approached the shore, and I was asked
if I was not glad to see my former self? At these words I
experienced a certain discomfort, partly because I did not
expect any great joy from myself, and partly because I
feared my young friend would ask for his own body back
again. However, I turned to the water, and saw my second
self swimming close up to me, and laughing at me
with his head turned a little on one side. “There is no
swimming with those limbs of yours,” exclaimed he, “I
have had a fine struggle against waves and breakers, and it
is not to be wondered at that I have come so late, and am
last of all.” I at once recognized the countenance; it was
my own, but grown young, and rather fuller and broader,
with the freshest complexion. He now came to land, and
whilst he raised himself and first stepped along the sand, I
had a view of his back and legs, and was delighted with
the perfection of the form. He came up the rocky shore to
us, and as he came up to me he had completely my new
stature. “How is it,” thought I to myself, “that your little
body has grown so handsome. Have the primeval powers
of the sea operated so wonderfully upon it, or is it because
the youthful spirit of my friend has penetrated the limbs?”
Whilst we enjoyed ourselves together for some time, I
silently wondered that my friend did not show any inclination
to resume his own body. “Truly,” thought I,
“he looks bravely, and it may be a matter of indifference to
him in which body he is placed, but it is not the same
thing to me; for I am not sure whether in that body I may
not shrink and become as diminutive as before.” In order
to satisfy myself on this point, I took my friend aside, and
asked him how he felt in my limbs? “Perfectly well,”
said he; “I have the same sensation of my own natural
power as before; I do not know what you have to complain
of in your limbs. They are quite right with me; and you
see one only has to make the best of oneself. Remain in
my body as long as you please; for I am perfectly contented
to remain in yours through all futurity.” I was much
pleased by this explanation, and as in all my sensations,
thoughts, and recollections, I felt quite as usual, my dream
gave me the impression of a perfect independence of the
soul, and the possibility of a future existence in another
body.</p>

<p>“That is a very pretty dream,” said Goethe, when, after
dinner to-day, I imparted to him the principal features.
“We see,” continued he, “that the muses visit you even in
sleep, and, indeed, with particular favor; for you must confess
that it would be difficult for you to invent anything so
peculiar and pretty in your waking moments.”</p>

<p>“I can scarcely conceive how it happened to me,” returned
I; “for I had felt so dejected all day, that the contemplation
of so fresh a life was far from my mind.”</p>

<p>“Human nature possesses wonderful powers,” returned
Goethe, “and has something good in readiness for us when
we least hope for it. There have been times in my life
when I have fallen asleep in tears; but in my dreams the
most charming forms have come to console and to cheer
me, and I have risen the next morning fresh and joyful.</p>

<p>“There is something more or less wrong among us old
Europeans; our relations are far too artificial and complicated,
our nutriment and mode of life are without their
proper nature, and our social intercourse is without proper
love and good will. Every one is polished and courteous;
but no one has the courage to be hearty and true, so that an
honest man, with natural views and feelings, stands in a
very bad position. Often one can not help wishing that
one had been born upon one of the South Sea Islands, a so-called
savage, so as to have thoroughly enjoyed human existence
in all its purity, without any adulteration.</p>

<p>“If in a depressed mood one reflects deeply upon the
wretchedness of our age, it often occurs to one that the
world is gradually approaching the last day. And the evil
accumulates from generation to generation! For it is not
enough that we have to suffer for the sins of our fathers,
but we hand down to posterity these inherited vices increased
by our own.”</p>

<p>“Similar thoughts often occur to me,” answered I; “but
if, at such a time, I see a regiment of German dragoons
ride by me, and observe the beauty and power of these
young people, I again derive some consolation, and say to
myself, that the durability of mankind is after all not in
such a desperate plight.”</p>

<p>“Our country people,” returned Goethe, “have certainly
kept up their strength, and will, I hope, long be able not
only to furnish us with good horsemen, but also to secure
us from total decay and destruction. The rural population
may be regarded as a magazine, from which the forces of
declining mankind are always recruited and refreshed.
But just go into our great towns, and you will feel quite
differently. Just take a turn by the side of a second <i>diable
boiteux</i>, or a physician with a large practice, and he will
whisper to you tales which will horrify you at the misery,
and astonish you at the vice with which human nature is
visited, and from which society suffers.</p>

<p>“But let us banish these hypochondriacal thoughts.
How are you going on? What are you doing? What else
have you seen to-day? Tell me, and inspire me with good
thoughts.”</p>

<p>“I have been reading Sterne,” returned I, “where
Yorick is sauntering about the streets of Paris, and makes
the remark that every tenth man is a dwarf. I thought of
that when you mentioned the vices of great towns. I also
remember to have seen, in Napoleon’s time, among the
French infantry, one battalion which consisted entirely of
Parisians, who were all such puny, diminutive people, that
one could not comprehend what could be done with them
in battle.”</p>

<p>“The Scotch Highlanders, under the Duke of Wellington,”
rejoined Goethe, “were doubtless heroes of another
description.”</p>

<p>“I saw them in Brussels a year before the battle of
Waterloo,” returned I. “They were, indeed, fine men; all
strong, fresh, and active, as if just from the hand of their
Maker. They all carried their heads so freely and gallantly,
and stepped so lightly along with their strong, bare
legs, that it seemed as if there were no original sin, and no
ancestral failing, as far as they were concerned.”</p>

<p>“There is something peculiar in this,” said Goethe.
“Whether it lies in the race, in the soil, in the free political
constitution, or in the healthy tone of education,—certainly,
the English in general appear to have certain advantages
over many others. Here in Weimar, we see only a few of
them, and, probably, by no means the best; but what fine,
handsome people they are. And however young they come
here, they feel themselves by no means strange or embarrassed
in this foreign atmosphere; on the contrary, their
deportment in society is as full of confidence, and as easy
as if they were lords everywhere, and the whole world belonged
to them. This it is which pleases our women, and
by which they make such havoc in the hearts of our young
ladies. As a German father of a family, who is concerned
for the tranquility of his household, I often feel a slight
shudder, when my daughter-in-law announces to me the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
expected arrival of some fresh, young islander. I already
see in my mind’s eye the tears which will one day flow
when he takes his departure. They are dangerous young
people; but this very quality of being dangerous is their
virtue.”</p>

<p>“Still, I would not assert,” answered I, “that the young
Englishmen in Weimar are more clever, more intelligent,
better informed, or more excellent at heart than other
people.”</p>

<p>“The secret does not lie in these things, my good friend,”
returned Goethe. “Neither does it lie in birth and riches;
it lies in the courage which they have to be that for which
nature has made them. There is nothing vitiated or spoilt
about them, there is nothing half-way or crooked; but such
as they are, they are thoroughly complete men. That they
are also sometimes complete fools, I allow with all my
heart; but that is still something, and has still always some
weight in the scale of nature.</p>

<p>“The happiness of personal freedom, the consciousness of
an English name, and of the importance attached to it by
other nations, is an advantage even to the children; for in
their own family, as well as in scholastic establishments,
they are treated with far more respect, and enjoy a far freer
development, than is the case with us Germans.</p>

<p>“In our own dear Weimar, I need only to look out of the
window to discover how matters stand with us. Lately,
when the snow was lying upon the ground, and my
neighbor’s children were trying their little sledges in the
street, the police was immediately at hand, and I saw the
poor little things fly as quickly as they could. Now, when
the spring sun tempts them from the houses, and they
would like to play with their companions before the door,
I see them always constrained, as if they were not safe,
and feared the approach of some despot of the police. Not
a boy may crack a whip, or sing or shout; the police is immediately
at hand to forbid it. This has the effect with us
all of taming youth prematurely, and of driving out all originality
and all wildness, so that in the end nothing remains
but the Philistine.</p>

<p>“You know that scarcely a day passes in which I am not
visited by some traveling foreigner. But if I were to say
that I took great pleasure in the personal appearance, especially
of young, learned Germans from a certain northeastern
quarter, I should tell a falsehood.</p>

<p>“Short-sighted, pale, narrow-chested, young without
youth; that is a picture of most of them as they appear to
me. And if I enter into a conversation with any of them,
I immediately observe that the things in which one of us
takes pleasure seem to them vain and trivial, that they are
entirely absorbed in the Idea, and that only the highest
problems of speculation are fitted to interest them. Of
sound senses or delight in the sensual, there is no trace;
all youthful feeling and all youthful pleasure are driven
out of them, and that irrecoverably; for if a man is not
young in his twentieth year, how can he be so in his
fortieth?”</p>

<p>Goethe sighed and was silent.</p>

<p>I thought of the happy time in the last century, in which
Goethe’s youth fell; the summer air of Sesenheim passed
before my soul, and I reminded him of the verses—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In the afternoon we sat,</div>
<div class="verse">Young people, in the cool.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Ah,” sighed Goethe, “those were, indeed, happy times.
But we will drive them from our minds, that the dark
foggy days of the present may not become quite insupportable.”</p>

<p>“A second Redeemer,” said I, “would be required to remove
from us the seriousness, the discomfort, and the monstrous
oppressiveness of the present state of things.”</p>

<p>“If he came,” answered Goethe, “he would be crucified a
second time. Still, we by no means need anything so
great. If we could only alter the Germans after the model
of the English, if we could only have less philosophy and
more power of action, less theory and more practice, we
might obtain a good share of redemption, without waiting
for the personal majesty of a second Christ. Much may be
done from below by the people by means of schools and domestic
education; much from above by the rulers and those
in immediate connection with them.</p>

<p>“Thus, for instance, I can not approve the requisition, in
the studies of future statesmen, of so much theoretically-learned
knowledge, by which young people are ruined before
their time, both in mind and body. When they enter
into practical service, they possess, indeed, an immense
stock of philosophical and learned matters; but in the
narrow circle of their calling, this can not be practically applied,
and must therefore be forgotten as useless. On the
other hand, what they most needed they have lost; they
are deficient in the necessary mental and bodily energy,
which is quite indispensable when one would enter properly
into practical life.</p>

<p>“And then, are not love and benevolence also needed in
the life of a statesman—in the management of men? And
how can any one feel and exercise benevolence toward another,
when he is ill at ease with himself?</p>

<p>“But all these people are in a dreadfully bad case. The
third part of the learned men and statesmen, shackled to
the desk, are ruined in body, and consigned to the demon of
hypochondria. Here there should be action from above
that future generations may at least be preserved from a
like destruction.</p>

<p>“In the meantime,” continued Goethe, smiling, “let us
remain in a state of hopeful expectation as to the condition
of us Germans a century hence, and whether we shall then
have advanced so far as to be no longer <i>savants</i> and philosophers,
but men.”</p>

<p>Now, it has occurred to me, when I recollect, that we love
our children, and call them our second selves, merely because
we have begotten them, that there is another kind of
progeny springing from us, not less worthy of our esteem;
for what we engender by the mind, the offspring of our understanding,
diligence, and genius, emanates from nobler
parts of us than what springs from the body, and is much
more our own. We are both father and mother in this act
of generation. They cost us more and bring us more honor
if they have any good in them. For the value of our other
children depends much more on themselves than on us;
the share we have in them is very little, but of these all the
beauty, grace, and excellence is ours. For in this way they
are a more complete representation and copy of ourselves
than the others. Plato adds that these are immortal children
which truly immortalize and deify their fathers, as
Lycurgus, Solon, and Mino.—<i>Montaigne.</i></p>

<p>In my opinion the want of occupation is no less the plague
of society than of solitude. Nothing is so apt to narrow
the mind; nothing produces more trifling, silly stories, mischief-making,
lies, than being eternally shut up in a room
with one another, reduced as the only alternative to be constantly
twaddling. When everybody is occupied, we only
speak when we have something to say; but when we are
doing nothing, we are compelled to be always talking, and
of all torments, that is the most annoying and the most
dangerous.—<i>Rousseau.</i></p></div>

<h3>A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM.</h3>

<p>There was a law in the city of Athens, which gave to its
citizens the power of compelling their daughters to marry
whomsoever they pleased; for upon a daughter’s refusing to
marry the man her father had chosen to be her husband, the
father was empowered by this law to cause her to be put to
death; but as fathers do not often desire the death of their
own daughters, even though they do happen to prove a little
refractory, this law was seldom or never put into execution,
though perhaps the young ladies of that city were not unfrequently
threatened by their parents with the terrors of it.</p>

<p>There was one instance, however, of an old man, whose
name was Egeus, who actually did come before Theseus (at
that time the reigning duke of Athens), to complain that
his daughter Hermia, whom he had commanded to marry
Demetrius, a young man of a noble Athenian family, refused
to obey him, because she loved another young Athenian,
named Lysander. Egeus demanded justice of Theseus, and
desired that this cruel law might be put in force against his
daughter.</p>

<p>Hermia pleaded in excuse for her disobedience, that Demetrius
had formerly professed love for her dear friend Helena,
and that Helena loved Demetrius to distraction; but this
honorable reason, which Hermia gave for not obeying her
father’s command, moved not the stern Egeus.</p>

<p>Theseus, though a great and merciful prince, had no
power to alter the laws of his country; therefore he could
only give Hermia four days to consider of it, and at the end
of that time, if she still refused to marry Demetrius, she was
to be put to death.</p>

<p>When Hermia was dismissed from the presence of the
duke, she went to her lover Lysander, and told him the
peril she was in, and that she must either give up him and
marry Demetrius, or lose her life in four days.</p>

<p>Lysander was in great affliction at hearing these evil
tidings, but recollecting that he had an aunt who lived at
some distance from Athens, and that at the place where she
lived the cruel law could not be put in force against Hermia
(this law not extending beyond the boundaries of the city),
he proposed to Hermia that she should steal out of her
father’s house that night, and go with him to his aunt’s
house, where he would marry her. “I will meet you,” said
Lysander, “in the wood a few miles without the city; in
that delightful wood, where we have so often walked with
Helena in the pleasant month of May.”</p>

<p>To this proposal Hermia joyfully agreed, and she told no
one of her intended flight but her friend Helena. Helena
(as maidens will do foolish things for love) very ungenerously
resolved to go and tell this to Demetrius, though she
could hope no benefit from betraying her friend’s secret, but
the poor pleasure of following her faithless lover to the
wood; for she well knew that Demetrius would go thither
in pursuit of Hermia.</p>

<p>The wood in which Lysander and Hermia proposed to
meet, was the favorite haunt of those little beings known by
the name of fairies. Oberon, the king, and Titania, the
queen of the fairies, with all their tiny train of followers, in
this wood held their midnight revels.</p>

<p>Between this little king and queen of sprites there happened
at this time a sad disagreement, they never met by
moonlight in the shady walks of this pleasant wood, but
they were quarreling, till all their fairy elves would creep
into acorn-cups and hide themselves for fear. The cause
of this unhappy disagreement was Titania’s refusing to give
Oberon a little changeling boy, whose mother had been
Titania’s friend; and upon her death the fairy queen stole
the child from its nurse, and brought him up in the woods.</p>

<p>The night on which the lovers were to meet in this wood,
as Titania was walking with some of her maids of honor,
she met Oberon attended by his train of fairy courtiers. “Ill
met by moonlight, proud Titania,” said the fairy king. The
queen replied, “What, jealous Oberon, is it you?” “Fairies,
skip hence; I have forsworn his company.” “Tarry, rash
fairy,” said Oberon; “am not I thy lord? Why does Titania
cross her Oberon? Give me your little changeling boy to be
my page.”</p>

<p>“Set your heart at rest,” answered the queen; “your whole
fairy kingdom buys not the boy of me.” She then left her
lord in great anger.</p>

<p>“Well, go your way,” said Oberon; “before the morning:
dawns I will torment you for this injury.” Oberon then sent
for Puck, his chief favorite and privy counselor.</p>

<p>Puck (or, as he was sometimes called, Robin Goodfellow)
was a shrewd and knavish sprite, that used to play comical
pranks in the neighboring villages; sometimes getting into
the dairies and skimming the milk, sometimes plunging his
light and airy form into the butter-churn, and while he was
dancing his fantastic shape in the vessel, in vain the dairy-maid
would labor to change her cream into butter: nor had
the village swains any better success; whenever Puck chose
to play his freaks in the brewing-copper, the ale was sure to
be spoiled. When a few good neighbors were met to drink
some comfortable ale together, Puck would jump into the
bowl of ale in the likeness of a roasted crab, and when some
old goody was going to drink, he would bob against her lips,
and spill the ale over her withered chin; and presently after,
when the same old dame was gravely seating herself to tell
her neighbors a sad and melancholy story, Puck would slip
her three-legged stool from under her, and down toppled
the poor old woman, and then the gossips would hold their
sides and laugh at her, and swear they never wasted a
merrier hour.</p>

<p>“Come hither, Puck,” said Oberon to this little merry
wanderer of the night; “fetch me the flower which maids
call Love in Idleness; the juice of that little purple flower,
laid on the eye-lids of those who sleep, will make them,
when they awake, doat on the first thing they see. Some
of the juice of that flower I will drop on the eyelids of my
Titania, when she is asleep; and the first thing she looks
upon when she opens her eyes, she will fall in love with,
even though it be a lion, or a bear, a meddling monkey,
or a busy ape: and before I will take this charm from off
her sight, which I can do with another charm I know of, I
will make her give me that boy to be my page.”</p>

<p>Puck, who loved mischief to his heart, was highly diverted
with this intended frolic of his master, and ran to
seek the flower; and while Oberon was waiting the return
of Puck, he observed Demetrius and Helena enter the
woods; he overheard Demetrius reproaching Helena for
following him, and after many unkind words on his part,
and gentle expostulations from Helena, reminding him of
his former love, and professions of true faith to her, he left
her (as he said) to the mercy of the wild beasts, and she ran
after him as swiftly as she could.</p>

<p>The fairy king, who was always friendly to true lovers,
felt great compassion for Helena; and perhaps, as Lysander
said they used to walk by moonlight in this pleasant wood,
Oberon might have seen Helena in those happy times when
she was beloved by Demetrius. However that might be,
when Puck returned with the little purple flower, Oberon
said to his favorite, “Take a part of the flower: there has
been a sweet Athenian lady here, who is in love with a disdainful
youth; if you find him sleeping, drop some of the
love-juice in his eyes, but contrive to do it when she is near
him, that the first thing he sees when he awakes may be
this despised lady. You will know the man by the Athenian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
garments which he wears.” Puck promised to manage
this matter very dexterously; and then Oberon went,
unperceived by Titania, to her bower where she was preparing
to go to rest. Her fairy bower was a bank, where grew
wild thyme, cowslips, and sweet violets, under a canopy of
woodbine, musk-roses and eglantine. There Titania always
slept some part of the night; her coverlet the enamelled
skin of a snake, which, though a small mantle, was wide
enough to wrap a fairy in.</p>

<p>He found Titania giving orders to her fairies, how they
were to employ themselves while she slept. “Some of you,”
said her majesty, “must kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
and some wage war with the bats for their leathern wings,
to make my small elves coats; and some of you keep watch
that the clamorous owl, that nightly hoots, come not near
me: but first sing me to sleep.” Then they began to sing
this song:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">You spotted snakes with double tongue,</div>
<div class="verse">Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;</div>
<div class="verse">Newts and blind-worms do no wrong,</div>
<div class="verse">Come not near our Fairy Queen.</div>
<div class="verse">Philomel, with melody,</div>
<div class="verse">Sing in our sweet lullaby,</div>
<div class="verse">Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby:</div>
<div class="verse">Never harm, nor spell, nor charm,</div>
<div class="verse">Come our lovely lady nigh;</div>
<div class="verse">So good night with lullaby.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When the fairies had sung their queen asleep with this
pretty lullaby, they left her, to perform the important services
she had enjoined them. Oberon then softly drew near
his Titania, and dropt some of the love-juice on her eye-lids,
saying—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">What thou seest when thou dost wake,</div>
<div class="verse">Do it for thy true-love take.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But to return to Hermia, who made her escape out of her
father’s house that night, to avoid the death she was doomed
to for refusing to marry Demetrius. When she entered the
wood, she found her dear Lysander, waiting for her, to conduct
her to his aunt’s house; but before they had passed half
through the wood, Hermia was so much fatigued, that Lysander,
who was very careful of this dear lady, that had
proved her affection for him even by hazarding her life for
his sake, persuaded her to rest till morning on a bank of
soft moss; and, lying down himself on the ground at some
little distance, they soon fell fast asleep. Here they were
found by Puck, who, seeing a handsome young man asleep,
and perceiving that his clothes were made in the Athenian
fashion, and that a pretty lady was sleeping near him, concluded
that this must be the Athenian maid and her disdainful
lover, whom Oberon had sent him to seek; and he naturally
enough conjectured that, as they were alone together,
she must be the first thing he would see when he awoke; so
without more ado, he proceeded to pour some of the juice of
the little purple flower into his eyes. But it so fell out that
Helena came that way, and, instead of Hermia, was the
first object Lysander beheld when he opened his eyes; and,
strange to relate, so powerful was the love-charm, all his
love for Hermia vanished away, and Lysander fell in love
with Helena.</p>

<p>Had he first seen Hermia when he awoke, the blunder
Puck committed would have been of no consequence, for he
could not love that faithful lady too well; but for poor Lysander
to be forced by a fairy love-charm to forget his own
true Hermia, and to run after another lady, and leave Hermia
asleep quite alone in a wood at midnight, was a sad
chance indeed.</p>

<p>Thus this misfortune happened. Helena, as has been before
related, endeavored to keep pace with Demetrius when
he ran away so rudely from her; but she could not continue
this unequal race long, men being always better runners in a
long race than ladies. Helena soon lost sight of Demetrius;
and as she was wandering about, dejected and forlorn, she
arrived at the place where Lysander was sleeping. “Ah!”
said she, “this is Lysander lying on the ground; is he dead
or asleep?” Then gently touching him, she said, “Good
sir, if you are alive, awake.” Upon this Lysander opened
his eyes, and (the love-charm beginning to work) immediately
addressed her in terms of extravagant love and admiration;
telling her, she as much excelled Hermia in beauty
as a dove does a raven, and that he would run through fire
for her sweet sake; and many more such lover-like speeches.
Helena, knowing Lysander was her friend Hermia’s lover,
and that he was solemnly engaged to marry her, was in the
utmost rage when she heard herself addressed in this manner;
for she thought (as well she might) that Lysander was
making a jest of her. “Oh!” said she, “why was I born to
be mocked and scorned by every one? Is it not enough, is
it not enough, young man, that I can never get a sweet look
or a kind word from Demetrius; but you, sir, must pretend,
in this disdainful manner, to court me? I thought, Lysander,
you were a lord of more true gentleness.” Saying
these words in great anger, she ran away; and Lysander
followed her, quite forgetful of his own Hermia, who was
still asleep.</p>

<p>When Hermia awoke, she was in a sad fright at finding
herself alone. She wandered about the wood, not knowing
what was become of Lysander, or which way to go to seek
for him. In the meantime Demetrius, not being able to
find Hermia and his rival Lysander, and fatigued with his
fruitless search, was observed by Oberon fast asleep.
Oberon had learnt, by some questions he had asked of Puck,
that he had applied the love-charm to the wrong person’s
eyes; and now, having found the person first intended, he
touched the eyelids of the sleeping Demetrius with the love-juice,
and he instantly awoke; and the first thing he saw
being Helena, he, as Lysander had done before, began to
address love speeches to her; and just at that moment Lysander,
followed by Hermia (for, through Puck’s unlucky
mistake, it was now become Hermia’s turn to run after
her lover), made his appearance; and then Lysander and
Demetrius, both speaking together, made love to Helena,
they being each one under the influence of the same potent
charm.</p>

<p>The astonished Helena thought that Demetrius, Lysander,
and her once dear friend Hermia, were all in a plot together
to make a jest of her.</p>

<p>Hermia was as much surprised as Helena; she knew not
why Lysander and Demetrius, who both before loved her,
were now become the lovers of Helena; and to Hermia the
matter seemed to be no jest.</p>

<p>The ladies, who before had always been the dearest of
friends, now fell to high words together.</p>

<p>“Unkind Hermia,” said Helena, “it is you have set Lysander
on, to vex with mock praises; and your other lover,
Demetrius, who used almost to spurn me with his foot, have
you not bid him call me goddess, nymph, rare, precious,
and celestial? He would not speak thus to me whom he
hates, if you did not set him on to make a jest of me. Unkind
Hermia, to join with men in scorning your poor friend.
Have you forgot our school-day friendship? How often,
Hermia, have we two, sitting on one cushion, both singing
one song, with our needles working the same flower, both on
the same sampler wrought; growing up together in fashion
of a double cherry, scarcely seeming parted? Hermia, it is
not friendly in you, it is not maidenly, to join with men in
scorning your poor friend.”</p>

<p>“I am amazed at your passionate words,” said Hermia.
“I scorn you not; it seems you scorn me.”</p>

<p>“Ay, do,” returned Helena, “persevere; counterfeit serious
looks, and make mouths at me when I turn my back;
then wink at each other, and hold the sweet jest up. If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
had any pity, grace, or manners, you would not use me
thus.”</p>

<p>While Helena and Hermia were speaking these angry
words to each other, Demetrius and Lysander left them, to
fight together in the wood for the love of Helena. When
they found the gentlemen had left them, they departed, and
once more wandered weary in the wood in search of their
lovers.</p>

<p>As soon as they were gone, the king fairy, who with
little Puck had been listening to their quarrels, said to him,
“This is your negligence, Puck; or did you do this wilfully?”
“Believe me, king of shadows,” answered Puck,
“it was a mistake; did not you tell me I should know the
man by his Athenian garments? However, I am not sorry
this has happened, for I think their jangling makes excellent
sport.” “You heard,” said Oberon, “that Demetrius
and Lysander are gone to seek a convenient place to fight
in. I command you to overhang the night with a thick fog,
and lead these quarrelsome lovers so astray in the dark, that
they shall not be able to find each other. Counterfeit each
of their voices to the other, and with bitter taunts provoke
them to follow you, while they think it is their rival’s
tongue they hear. See you do this, till they are so weary they
can go no farther; and when you find they are asleep, drop
the juice of this other flower into Lysander’s eyes, and when
he awakes he will forget his new love for Helena, and return
to his old passion for Hermia; and then the two fair ladies
may each one be happy with the man she loves, and they
will think all that has passed a vexatious dream. About
this quickly, Puck; and I will go and see what sweet love
my Titania has found.”</p>

<p>Titania was still sleeping, and Oberon, seeing a clown near
her, who had lost his way in the wood, and was likewise
asleep—“This fellow,” said he, “shall be my Titania’s true-love;”
and clapping an ass’s head over the clown’s, it
seemed to fit him as well as if it had grown upon his own
shoulders. Though Oberon fixed the ass’s head on very
gently, it awakened him, and rising up, unconscious of what
Oberon had done to him, he went toward the bower where
the fairy queen slept.</p>

<p>“Ah! what angel is that I see!” said Titania, opening her
eyes, and the juice of the little purple flower beginning to
take effect: “are you as wise as you are beautiful?” “Why,
mistress,” said the clown, “if I have wit enough to find the
way out of this wood, I have enough to serve my turn.”</p>

<p>“Out of the wood do not desire to go,” said the enamored
queen. “I am a spirit of no common rate. I love you. Go
with me, and I will give you fairies to attend upon you.”
She then called four of her fairies: their names were Pease-blossom,
Cobweb, Moth, and Mustard-seed. “Attend,”
said the queen, “upon this sweet gentleman; hop in his
walks, and gambol in his sight; feed him with grapes and
apricots, and steal for him the honey-bags from the bees.
Come sit with me,” she said to the clown, “and let me play
with your amiable hairy cheeks, my beautiful ass; and kiss
your fair large ears, my gentle joy!”</p>

<p>“Where is Pease-blossom?” said the ass-headed clown,
not much regarding the fairy queen’s courtship, but very
proud of his new attendants. “Here, sir,” said little Pease-blossom.</p>

<p>“Scratch my head,” said the clown. “Where is Cobweb?”
“Here, sir,” said Cobweb. “Good Mr. Cobweb,” said the
foolish clown, “kill me the red humble-bee on the top of that
thistle yonder; and, good Mr. Cobweb, bring me the honey-bag.
Do not fret yourself too much in the action, Mr. Cobweb,
and take care the honey-bags break not; I should be
sorry to have you overflown with a honey-bag. Where is
Mustard-seed?”</p>

<p>“Here, sir,” said Mustard-seed; “what is your will?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said the clown, “but to help Mr. Pease-blossom
to scratch; I must go to a barber’s, Mr. Mustard-seed,
for methinks I am marvelous hairy about the face.”</p>

<p>“My sweet love,” said the queen; “what will you have to
eat? I have a venturous fairy shall seek the squirrel’s hoard,
and fetch you some new nuts.” “I had rather have a handful
of dried peas,” said the clown, who with his ass’s head
had got an ass’s appetite. “But, I pray, let none of your
people disturb me, for I have a mind to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Sleep, then,” said the queen, “and I will wind you in
my arms. O how I love you! how I dote upon you!”</p>

<p>When the fairy king saw the clown sleeping in the arms
of his queen, he advanced within her sight, and reproached
her with having lavished her favors upon an ass. This
she could not deny, as the clown was then sleeping within
her arms, with his ass’s head crowned by her with flowers.
When Oberon had teased her for some time, he again
demanded the changeling boy; which she, ashamed of
being discovered by her lord with her new favorite, did not
dare to refuse him.</p>

<p>Oberon, having thus obtained the little boy he had so long
wished for to be his page, took pity on the disgraceful situation
into which, by his merry contrivance, he had brought
his Titania, and threw some of the juice of the other flower
into her eyes; and the fairy queen immediately recovered
her senses, and wondered at her late dotage, saying how
she now loathed the sight of the strange monster. Oberon
likewise took the ass’s head from off the clown, and left him
to finish his nap with his own fool’s head upon his shoulders.
Oberon and his Titania being now perfectly reconciled,
he related to her the history of the lovers, and their midnight
quarrels; and she agreed to go with him, and see the
end of their adventures.</p>

<p>The fairy king and queen found the lovers and their fair
ladies at no great distance from each other, sleeping on a
grass plot; for Puck, to make amends for his former mistake,
had contrived to bring them all to the same spot, unknown
to each other; and he had removed the charm
from off the eyes of Lysander with the antidote the fairy
king gave to him.</p>

<p>Hermia first awoke, and finding her lost Lysander asleep
so near her, was looking at him, and wondering at his
strange inconstancy. Lysander presently opening his eyes,
and seeing his dear Hermia, recovered his reason, which
the fairy-charm had before clouded, and with his reason,
his love for Hermia; and they began to talk over the adventures
of the night, doubting if these things had really happened,
or if they had both been dreaming the same bewildering
dream.</p>

<p>Helena and Demetrius were by this time awake; and a
sweet sleep having quieted Helena’s disturbed and angry
spirits, she listened with delight to the professions of love
which Demetrius still made to her, and which, to her
surprise as well as pleasure, she began to perceive were
sincere.</p>

<p>These fair night-wandering ladies, now no longer rivals,
became once more true friends; all the unkind words which
had passed were forgiven, and they calmly consulted together
what was best to be done in their present situation.
It was soon agreed that, as Demetrius had given up his
pretensions to Hermia, she should endeavor to prevail upon
her father to revoke the cruel sentence of death which had
been passed against her. Demetrius was preparing to return
to Athens for this friendly purpose, when they were
surprised with the sight of Egeus, Hermia’s father, who
came to the wood in pursuit of his runaway daughter.</p>

<p>When Egeus understood that Demetrius would not now
marry his daughter, he no longer opposed her marriage with
Lysander, but gave his consent that they should be wedded
on the fourth day from that time, being the same day on
which Hermia had been condemned to lose her life; and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
that same day Helena joyfully agreed to marry her beloved
and now faithful Demetrius.</p>

<p>The fairy king and queen, who were invisible spectators
of this reconciliation, and now saw the happy ending of the
lovers’ history brought about through the good offices of
Oberon, received so much pleasure, that these kind spirits
resolved to celebrate the approaching nuptials with sports
and revels throughout their fairy kingdom.</p>

<p>And now, if any are offended with this story of fairies and
their pranks, as judging it incredible and strange, they have
only to think that they have been asleep and dreaming, and
that all these adventures were visions which they saw in
their sleep: and I hope none of my readers will be so unreasonable
as to be offended with a pretty harmless Midsummer
Night’s Dream.</p>

<h3><a id="THE_WINTERS_TALE"></a>THE WINTER’S TALE.</h3>

<p>Leontes, king of Sicily, and his queen, the beautiful and
virtuous Hermione, once lived in the greatest harmony together.
So happy was Leontes in the love of this excellent
lady, that he had no wish ungratified, except that he
sometimes desired to see again, and present to his queen,
his old companion and school-fellow, Polixenes, king of
Bohemia. Leontes and Polixenes were brought up together
from their infancy; but being, by the death of their
fathers, called to reign over their respective kingdoms, they
had not met for many years, though they frequently interchanged
gifts, letters, and loving embassies.</p>

<p>At length, after repeated invitations, Polixenes came
from Bohemia to the Sicilian court, to make his friend
Leontes a visit.</p>

<p>At first this visit gave nothing but pleasure to Leontes.
He recommended the friend of his youth to the queen’s
particular attention, and seemed in the presence of his dear
friend and old companion to have his felicity quite completed.
They talked over old times; their school-days and
their youthful pranks were remembered and recounted to
Hermione, who always took a cheerful part in these conversations.</p>

<p>When, after a long stay, Polixenes was preparing to depart,
Hermione, at the desire of her husband, joined her
entreaties to his that Polixenes would prolong his visit.</p>

<p>And now began this good queen’s sorrow; for Polixenes
refusing to stay at the request of Leontes, was won over by
Hermione’s gentle and persuasive words to put off his departure
for some weeks longer. Upon this, although
Leontes had so long known the integrity and honorable
principles of his friend Polixenes, as well as the excellent
disposition of his virtuous queen, he was seized with an ungovernable
jealousy. Every attention Hermione showed
to Polixenes, though by her husband’s particular desire,
and merely to please him, increased the unfortunate king’s
malady; and from being a loving and a true friend, and the
best and fondest of husbands, Leontes became suddenly a
savage and inhuman monster. Sending for Camillo, one
of the lords of his court, and telling him of the suspicion he
entertained, he commanded him to poison Polixenes.</p>

<p>Camillo was a good man; and he, well knowing that the
jealousy of Leontes had not the slightest foundation in
truth, instead of poisoning Polixenes, acquainted him with
the king his master’s orders, and agreed to escape with him
out of the Sicilian dominions; and Polixenes, with the assistance
of Camillo, arrived safe in his own kingdom of Bohemia,
where Camillo lived from that time in the king’s
court, and became the chief friend and favorite of Polixenes.</p>

<p>The flight of Polixenes enraged the jealous Leontes still
more; he went to the queen’s apartment, where the good
lady was sitting with her little son Mamillus, who was just
beginning to tell one of his best stories to amuse his mother,
when the king entered, and taking the child away, sent
Hermione to prison.</p>

<p>Mamillus, though but a very young child, loved his
mother tenderly; and when he saw her so dishonored, and
found she was taken from him to be put into a prison, he
took it deeply to heart, and drooped and pined away by
slow degrees, losing his appetite and his sleep, till it was
thought his grief would kill him.</p>

<p>The king, when he had sent his queen to prison, commanded
Cleomenes and Dion, two Sicilian lords, to go to
Delphos, there to inquire of the oracle at the temple of
Apollo if his queen still really loved him.</p>

<p>When Hermione had been a short time in prison, she
gave birth to a daughter; and the poor lady received much
comfort from the sight of her pretty baby, and she said to
it, “My poor little prisoner, I am as innocent as you are.”
Hermione had a kind friend in the noble-spirited Paulina,
who was the wife of Antigonus, a Sicilian lord; and when
the lady Paulina heard her royal mistress had got a daughter,
she went to the prison where Hermione was confined,
and she said to Emilia, a lady who attended upon Hermione,
“I pray you, Emilia, tell the good queen, if her majesty
dare trust me with her little babe, I will carry it to the
king, its father; we do not know how he may soften at the
sight of his innocent child.” “Most worthy madam,” replied
Emilia, “I will acquaint the queen with your noble
offer; she was wishing to-day that she had any friend who
would venture to present the child to the king.” “And tell
her,” said Paulina, “that I will speak boldly to Leontes
in her defence.” “May you be forever blessed!” said
Emilia, “for your kindness to our gracious queen!” Emilia
then went to Hermione, who joyfully gave up her baby to
the care of Paulina, for she had feared that no one would
dare venture to present the child to its father.</p>

<p>Paulina took the new-born infant, and forcing herself into
the king’s presence, notwithstanding her husband, fearing
the king’s anger, endeavored to prevent her, she laid the
babe at its father’s feet, and Paulina made a noble speech to
the king in defence of Hermione, and she reproached him
severely for his inhumanity, and implored him to have
mercy on his innocent wife and child. But Paulina’s
spirited remonstrances only aggravated Leontes’s displeasure,
and he ordered her husband Antigonus to take her from
his presence.</p>

<p>When Paulina went away, she left the little baby at its
father’s feet, thinking, when he was alone with it, he would
look upon it, and have pity on its helpless innocence.</p>

<p>The good Paulina was mistaken; for no sooner was she
gone than the merciless father ordered Antigonus, Paulina’s
husband, to take the child, and carry it out to sea, and leave
it upon some desert shore to perish.</p>

<p>Antigonus, unlike the good Camillo, too well obeyed the
orders of Leontes; for he immediately carried the child on
shipboard, and put out to sea, intending to leave it on the
first desert coast he could find.</p>

<p>So strongly was the king prejudiced against Hermione,
that he would not wait for the return of Cleomenes and Dion,
whom he had sent to consult the oracle of Apollo at Delphos;
but before the queen was recovered, and while she
still grieved for the loss of her precious baby, he had her
brought to a public trial before all the lords and nobles of
his court. And when all the great lords, the judges, and all
the nobility of the land were assembled together to try
Hermione, and that unhappy queen was standing as a prisoner
before her subjects to receive their judgment, Cleomenes
and Dion entered the assembly, and presented to the
king the answer of the oracle sealed up; and Leontes commanded
the seal to be broken, and the words of the oracle
to be read aloud, and these were the words: “Hermione is
innocent, Polixenes blameless, Camillo a true subject, Leontes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
a jealous tyrant, and the king shall live without an
heir if that which is lost be not found.” The king would
give no credit to the words of the oracle; he said it was a
falsehood invented by the queen’s friends, and he desired
the judge to proceed in the trial of the queen. But while
Leontes was speaking, a man entered and told him that the
prince Mamillus, hearing that his mother was to be tried for
her life, struck with grief and shame, had suddenly died.</p>

<p>Hermione, upon hearing of the death of this dear affectionate
child, who had lost his life in sorrowing for her
misfortune, fainted; and Leontes, pierced to the heart by
the news, began to feel pity for his unhappy queen, and he
ordered Paulina, and the ladies who were her attendants, to
take her away, and use means for her recovery. Paulina
soon returned, and told the king that Hermione was dead.</p>

<p>When Leontes heard that the queen was dead, he repented
of his cruelty to her; and now that he thought his ill
usage had broken Hermione’s heart he believed her innocent;
and he now thought the words of the oracle were true,
as he knew “if that which was lost was not found” which
he concluded was his young daughter, he should be without
an heir, the young prince Mamillus being dead, and he
would give his kingdom now to recover his lost daughter;
and Leontes gave himself up to remorse, and passed many
years in mournful thoughts and repentant grief.</p>

<p>The ship in which Antigonus carried the infant princess
out to sea was driven by a storm upon the coast of Bohemia,
the very kingdom of the good king Polixenes. Here Antigonus
landed, and here he left the little baby.</p>

<p>Antigonus never returned to Sicily to tell Leontes where
he had left his daughter, for, as he was going back to the
ship, a bear came out of the woods and tore him to pieces; a
just punishment on him for obeying the wicked order of
Leontes.</p>

<p>The child was dressed in rich clothes and jewels; for Hermione
had made it very fine when she sent it to Leontes,
and Antigonus had pinned a paper to its mantle, with the
name <i>Perdita</i> written thereon, and words obscurely intimating
its high birth and untoward fate.</p>

<p>This poor deserted baby was found by a shepherd. He
was a humane man, and so he carried the little Perdita
home to his wife, who nursed it tenderly; but poverty
tempted the shepherd to conceal the rich prize he had found:
therefore he left that part of the country, that no one might
know where he got his riches, and with part of Perdita’s
jewels he bought herds of sheep, and became a wealthy
shepherd. He brought up Perdita as his own child, and
she knew not she was any other than a shepherd’s daughter.</p>

<p>The little Perdita grew up a lovely maiden; and though
she had no better education than that of a shepherd’s daughter,
yet so did the natural graces she inherited from her
royal mother shine forth in her untutored mind, that no one
from her behavior would have known she had not been
brought up in her father’s court.</p>

<p>Polixenes, the king of Bohemia, had an only son, whose
name was Florizel. As this young prince was hunting near
the shepherd’s dwelling, he saw the old man’s supposed
daughter, and the beauty, modesty, and queen-like deportment
of Perdita caused him instantly to fall in love with
her. He soon, under the name of Doricles, and in the disguise
of a private gentleman, become a constant visitor at
the old shepherd’s house.</p>

<p>Florizel’s frequent absence from court alarmed Polixenes;
and setting people to watch his son, he discovered his love
for the shepherd’s daughter.</p>

<p>Polixenes then called for Camillo, the faithful Camillo,
who had preserved his life from the fury of Leontes, and desired
that he would accompany him to the house of the
shepherd, the supposed father of Perdita.</p>

<p>Polixenes and Camillo, both in disguise, arrived at the
old shepherd’s dwelling, while they were celebrating the
feast of sheep-shearing; and though they were strangers,
yet at the sheep-shearing every guest being made welcome,
they were invited to walk in, and join in the general festivity.</p>

<p>Nothing but mirth and jollity was going forward. Tables
were spread, and great preparations were making for the rustic
feast. Some lads and lasses were dancing on the green
before the house, while others of the young men were buying
ribands, gloves, and such toys, of a peddler at the door.</p>

<p>While this busy scene was going forward, Florizel and
Perdita sat quietly in a retired corner, seemingly more
pleased with the conversation of each other, than desirous
of engaging in the sports and silly amusements of those
around them.</p>

<p>The king was so disguised that it was impossible his son
could know him; he therefore advanced near enough to
hear the conversation. The simple yet elegant manner in
which Perdita conversed with his son did not a little surprise
Polixenes. He said to Camillo, “This is the prettiest
low-born lass I ever saw; nothing she does or says but looks
like something greater than herself, too noble for this
place.”</p>

<p>Camillo replied, “Indeed she is the very queen of curds
and cream.”</p>

<p>“Pray, my good friend,” said the king to the old shepherd,
“what fair swain is that talking with your daughter?”
“They call him Doricles,” replied the shepherd. “He says
he loves my daughter; and to speak truth there is not a kiss
to choose which loves the other best. If young Doricles
can get her, she will bring him that he little dreams of,”
meaning the remainder of Perdita’s jewels; which, after he
had bought herds of sheep with part of them, he had carefully
hoarded up for her marriage portion.</p>

<p>Polixenes then addressed his son. “How now, young
man!” said he; “your heart seems full of something that
takes off your mind from feasting. When I was young, I
used to load my love with presents; but you have let the
peddler go, and have bought your lass no toy.”</p>

<p>The young prince, who little thought he was talking to
the king his father, replied, “Old sir, she prizes not such
trifles; the gifts which Perdita expects from me are locked
up in my heart.” Then turning to Perdita, he said to her,
“O hear me, Perdita, before this ancient gentleman, who it
seems was once himself a lover; he shall hear what I profess.”
Florizel then called upon the old stranger to be a
witness to a solemn promise of marriage which he made to
Perdita, saying to Polixenes, “I pray you, mark our contract.”</p>

<p>“Mark your divorce, young sir,” said the king, discovering
himself. Polixenes then reproached his son for daring
to contract himself to this low-born maiden, calling Perdita
“shepherd’s-brat, sheep-hook,” and other disrespectful
names; and threatening, if ever she suffered his son to see
her again, he would put her, and the old shepherd her
father, to a cruel death.</p>

<p>The king then left them in great wrath, and ordered
Camillo to follow him with Prince Florizel.</p>

<p>When the king had departed, Perdita, whose royal nature
was roused by Polixenes’s reproaches, said, “Though we
are all undone, I was not much afraid; and once or twice I
was about to speak, and tell him plainly that the self-same
sun that shines upon his palace, hides not his face from our
cottage, but looks on both alike.” Then sorrowfully she
said, “But now I am awakened from this dream. I will
queen it no farther. Leave me, sir; I will go milk my ewes
and weep.”</p>

<p>The kind-hearted Camillo was charmed with the spirit
and propriety of Perdita’s behavior; and perceiving that
the young prince was too deeply in love to give up his mistress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
at the command of his royal father, he thought of a
way to befriend the lovers, and at the same time to execute
a favorite scheme he had in his mind.</p>

<p>Camillo had long known that Leontes, the king of Sicily,
was become a true penitent; and though Camillo was now
the favored friend of King Polixenes, he could not help
wishing once more to see his late royal master and his native
home. He therefore proposed to Florizel and Perdita
that they should accompany him to the Sicilian court,
where he would engage Leontes should protect them, till
through his mediation they could obtain pardon from Polixenes
and his consent to their marriage.</p>

<p>To this proposal they joyfully agreed; and Camillo, who
conducted everything relative to their flight, allowed the
old shepherd to go along with them.</p>

<p>The shepherd took with him the remainder of Perdita’s
jewels, her baby clothes, and the paper which he had found
pinned to her mantle.</p>

<p>After a prosperous voyage, Florizel and Perdita, Camillo
and the old shepherd, arrived in safety at the court of
Leontes, who still mourned his dead Hermione and his lost
child, received Camillo with great kindness, and gave a cordial
welcome to Prince Florizel. But Perdita, whom Florizel
introduced as his princess, seemed to engross all Leontes’
attention. Perceiving a resemblance between her and his
dead queen Hermione, his grief broke out afresh, and he
said, such a lovely creature might his own daughter have
been, if he had not so cruelly destroyed her. “And then,
too,” said he to Florizel, “I lost the society and friendship
of your brave father, whom I now desire more than my life
once again to look upon.”</p>

<p>When the old shepherd heard how much notice the king
had taken of Perdita, and that he had lost a daughter, who
was exposed in infancy, he fell to comparing the time when
he found the little Perdita with the manner of its exposure,
the jewels and other high tokens of its high birth; from all
which it was impossible for him not to conclude that Perdita
and the king’s lost daughter were the same.</p>

<p>Florizel and Perdita, Camillo and the faithful Paulina,
were present when the old shepherd related to the king the
manner in which he had found the child, and also the circumstances
of Antigonus’s death, he having seen the bear
seize upon him. He showed the rich mantle in which Paulina
remembered Hermione had wrapped the child; and he
produced a jewel which she remembered Hermione had tied
about Perdita’s neck, and he gave up the paper, which Paulina
knew to be the writing of her husband; it could not be
doubted that Perdita was Leontes’ own daughter. But oh!
the noble struggles of Paulina, between sorrow for her husband’s
death, and joy that the oracle was fulfilled, in the
king’s heir, his long-lost daughter, being found. When
Leontes heard that Perdita was his daughter, the great sorrow
that he felt that Hermione was not living to behold her
child, made him that he could say nothing for a long time,
but, “O, thy mother, thy mother!”</p>

<p>Paulina interrupted this joyful yet distressful scene, with
saying to Leontes, that she had a statue, newly finished by
that rare Italian master, Julio Romano, which was such a
perfect resemblance of the queen, that would his majesty be
pleased to go to her house and look upon it, he would almost
be ready to think that it was Hermione herself. Thither
then they all went; the king anxious to see the semblance
of his Hermione, and Perdita longing to behold what the
mother she never saw did look like.</p>

<p>When Paulina drew back the curtain which concealed
this famous statue, so perfectly did it resemble Hermione,
that all the king’s sorrow was renewed at the sight; for a
long time he had no power to speak or move.</p>

<p>“I like your silence, my liege,” said Paulina, “it the more
shows your wonder. Is not this statue very like your queen?”</p>

<p>At length the king said, “O, thus she stood, even with
such majesty, when I first wooed her. But yet, Paulina,
Hermione was not so aged as this statue looks.” Paulina
replied, “So much the more the carver’s excellence, who
has made the statue as Hermione would have looked had
she been living now. But let me draw the curtain, sire, lest,
presently, you think it moves.”</p>

<p>The king then said, “Do not draw the curtain! Would I
were dead! See, Camillo, would you not think it breathed?
Her eye seems to have motion in it.” “I must draw the
curtain, my liege,” said Paulina. “You are so transported,
you will persuade yourself the statue lives.” “O, sweet
Paulina,” said Leontes, “make me think so twenty years
together! Still methinks there is an air comes from her.
What fine chisel could ever yet cut breath? Let no man
mock me, for I will kiss her.” “Good my lord, forbear!”
said Paulina. “The ruddiness upon her lip is wet; you
will stain your own with oily painting. Shall I draw the
curtain?” “No, not these twenty years,” said Leontes.</p>

<p>Perdita, who all this time had been kneeling, and beholding
in silent admiration the statue of her matchless mother,
said now, “And so long could I stay here, looking upon my
dear mother.”</p>

<p>“Either forbear this transport,” said Paulina to Leontes,
“and let me draw the curtain, or prepare yourself for more
amazement. I can make the statue move indeed; ay, and
descend from off the pedestal, and take you by the hand.
But then you will think, which I protest that I am not, that
I am assisted by some wicked powers.” “What you can
make her do,” said the astonished king, “I am content to
look upon. What you can make her speak, I am content to
hear; for it is as easy to make her speak as move.”</p>

<p>Paulina then ordered some slow and solemn music, which
she had prepared for the purpose, to strike up; and to the
amazement of all the beholders, the statue came down from
off the pedestal, and threw its arms around Leontes’s neck.
The statue then began to speak, praying for blessings on her
husband, and on her child, the newly found Perdita.</p>

<p>No wonder that the statue hung upon Leontes’s neck, and
blessed her husband and her child. No wonder, for the
statue was Hermione herself, the real, the living queen.</p>

<p>Paulina had falsely reported to the king the death of Hermione,
thinking that the only means to preserve her royal
mistress’s life; and with the good Paulina Hermione had
lived ever since, never choosing Leontes should know she
was living, till she heard Perdita was found; for though she
had long forgiven the injuries which Leontes had done to
herself, she could not pardon his cruelty to his infant daughter.</p>

<p>His dead queen thus restored to life, his lost daughter
found, the long-sorrowing Leontes could scarcely support
the excess of his own happiness. And as if nothing should
be wanting to complete this strange and unlooked-for joy,
king Polixenes himself now entered the palace.</p>

<p>When Polixenes first missed his son and Camillo, knowing
that Camillo had long wished to return to Sicily, he conjectured
he should find the fugitives there; and following
them with all speed, he happened to arrive just at this, the
happiest moment of Leontes’s life.</p>

<p>Polixenes took a part in the general joy; he forgave his
friend Leontes the unjust jealousy he had conceived against
him, and they once more loved each other with all the
warmth of their first boyish friendship. There was no
fear that Polixenes would now oppose his son’s marriage
with Perdita. She was no <i>sheep-hook</i> now, but the heiress
of the crown of Sicily.</p>

<p>Thus have we seen the patient virtues of the long-suffering
Hermione rewarded. That excellent lady lived many years
with her Leontes and her Perdita, the happiest of mothers
and queens.</p>

<p>“If you are going to keep a journal at all, begin the minute
you take off your waterproof.” This bit of wisdom descended
upon the quartette from the lips of the special correspondent
of the Perkinsville <i>Gazette</i>, one dripping morning
when we found her taking notes in the British Museum.
And surely she never said a wiser thing. First impressions
may not be profound or correct, or reach in any way the
heart and meaning of what passes under the eye, but they
are the freshest and often the only impressions worth recording.
One sees more in a first day in a new city than in
many subsequent days. The eyes are open then, if ever,
to all little peculiarities and characteristics; the ears catch
every unfamiliar tone; the perceptions are quickened into a
new and vivid interest, dissipated, alas, too soon! We Americans
quickly make ourselves at home. The novelty of to-day
is commonplace to-morrow, and the third day’s description
of an event takes only a word, where the first
day’s would have received a page. And there is no haunting
demon of travel quite so fiendish as the journal that
must be written, and that has “got behind.” One never can
quite subdue its clamor, nor does any effort at writing up
the half-forgotten record satisfy its insatiate demand. All
the pith and the life are gone out of the neglected recollections,
and we must accept the conclusion that it is <span class="smcap">NOT</span> safe
to wait after the “water-proof” is laid aside.</p>

<p>That some members of our quartette <i>did</i> wait was, perhaps,
a mercy to their friends, for it would have taken a
volume to describe what they saw and did in London. That
they studied their guide-books, and maps and histories, as
true Chautauquans should, goes without saying. They
tramped a great many miles and jostled in cabs and omnibuses
a great many more, and tried the tramways and the
underground road, and the penny boats upon the noiseless
highway of the Thames. Somewhere they had read that the
united streets of London made a stretch of over three thousand
miles, and they sometimes felt as if they had traversed
them all. They must visit every portion of the city, for
each had its peculiar interest or charm. How could they
fail, for example, to drive through the aristocratic Belgravia,
the district that, within the last quarter of a century, has
become a region of fine streets and spacious squares and
palatial residences, transforming as well as surpassing the
old West End. It seemed worth while to gaze, if only from
the windows of a cab, at the residences of the real aristocracy
of Britain, and better worth while to drive on, through
the once beautiful and rural Chelsea, now swarming with
the multitudes of London’s poor. The old city of Westminster,
now swallowed up in London, whose inhabitants
average a dozen inmates to every wretched home, touches
Belgravia on the southeast, lying, as one writer says, “Like
a filthy beggar at the rich man’s gate.” Not all the efforts
of public and private philanthropy, the theories of men like
Ruskin, or the practice of women like Octavia Hill, have
been able to stay its ever-swelling tide of misery and sin.
Strange contrast all this to the monotonous regularity of
Tyburnia, whose rows on rows of handsome dwellings constitute
the homes of professional men and wealthy merchants.
So-called middle-class London finds its home in
the Regent’s Square district. Thence, eastward still, and
we find ourselves in the Bloomsbury and Bedford Square
region, whose old houses, once occupied by rank and fashion,
are mostly given over to lodgers like ourselves, while
resident middle-class foreigners make their homes largely
in the region around Leicester Square. It takes no end of
wandering to familiarize the stranger with the characteristics
of each district, and if one can stay in London months,
it is a better way to begin than to select the special points
of interest.</p>

<p>London is large enough for a world, and has human interests
enough, if there were no other place on the planet, to occupy
the time and wisdom of angels and all good men. Somebody
calls it a “province covered with houses;” Carlyle spoke of
it as “the tuberosity of modern civilization.” The metropolis
includes more than the city of London, more than old
Westminster. Its arms have stretched out until it embraces
nearly forty adjacent townships and districts. Some
busy-brained statistician has amused himself by treating the
place as if it were a great living monster, whose gigantic
throat swallows yearly over nine millions of once living
creatures, either fish, flesh or fowl, washed down by fifty
millions of gallons of ale and wine. No wonder that there
follows close upon this statement, the grave announcement
that nearly three thousand physicians are constantly hastening
to and fro, and that five hundred undertakers do not
suffice to meet the city’s demands. The wine and liquor
merchants number nearly ten thousand, and we do not
wonder, this being so, that the paupers number nearly one
hundred and fifty thousand souls.</p>

<p>And of this great living mass of humanity, vital in every
part, the “city” proper is the pulsing heart. By it we mean
the space that anciently lay within the walls, keeping still
with few exceptions its narrow streets and shadowy lanes;
the former being the avenues of retail trade, while in the
latter the wholesale trade is carried on. As space could not
be commanded on the ground, the magnificent buildings required
for business that manipulates the wealth of the
world have had to occupy the air. Business houses stand
side by side with the dark low buildings of the seventeenth
century; and he who has time to penetrate some of the picturesque
old mansions now used as counting-rooms, will be
repaid by a sight of much that is architecturally quaint and
fine. No part of London is better worth exploring than
this. Our wanderers never tired of strolling from St. Paul’s,
after every brief rest under the stillness of its mighty dome,
into Paternoster-row, and lingering in the world of books
displayed on every hand; and the weaker half of the party
did not care how long they were left in the book stores,
while the more active wandered off into Lombard street,
among the bankers, into the exchanges, or the less imposing
though no less interesting Houndsditch, the haunt of the
modern Jew. All day long, from morn to night, a mighty
human tide swells and surges with almost turbulent haste
all through these narrow streets. One lingers and watches
daily as the never-ceasing throng pours on, fascinated as by
the constantly-recurring beat of the breakers upon the sea.
But come down here and stand under the shadow of St.
Paul’s some night, or on some calm Sunday afternoon.
The very air that hangs, heavy and still with the fog-damps,
above the great cross there on the old clock tower,
is not stiller than the ground beneath one’s feet. The hundreds
of thousands of people that composed the human
throng are gone, as if the earth had opened and swallowed
them. The merchants are in their homes at the West
End, the clerks in their humble homes in the suburbs.
Over twenty thousand buildings are left alone in the care of
the police, most of them houses once occupied as dwellings,
and now used for purposes of trade. There are nearly sixty
churches in the district, but the Sabbath stillness of the
streets is not due to the throngs gathered within the house
of God. They, indeed, are almost as empty as the streets,
for the residents who once rendered each parish populous
are no longer here. St. Paul’s, the cathedral church of the
See of London, is the present center of religious attraction,
and here our travelers passed many a quiet hour, to say
nothing of the more active seasons when they walked from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
tomb to tomb through all its length and breadth; paid
their shilling and descended into the crypt and stood by the
tomb of Wellington; paid another and climbed to the whispering
gallery; and another and another, and went to the
tower of the clock; and an extra sixpence and touched the
great bell that strikes the hour. The only other service
required of the bell is to toll at the deaths of members of the
royal family, the bishop of London, the dean of St. Paul’s,
and the mayors of London who may die in office. One and
sixpence once more, and the more adventurous of the quartette
climbed up and squeezed into the ball beneath the
cross, while the others lingered at the golden gallery near
the apex of the dome, and gazed down upon the fog, through
which the roofs and towers and spires seemed like a strange
shadowy spectre of a city, struggling for a tangible form.
Seen from the river, or from Blackfriars Bridge, the wonderful
dome stands out in all its beauty of outline; and early
one morning they saw from the latter point the great cross
glittering far above the city in the sunlight, which had not
yet scattered the fog on which it seemed to float.</p>

<p>Not much time had our tourists, however, for puzzling
their brains or harrowing their souls over the questions of
human destiny, for their heads were filled with all sorts of
associations with men and books, and they sometimes went
wandering to and fro, to find the very houses where their
favorite authors lived, the spots where events of interest
had transpired, the places made immortal by their poets’
pens. They must have their visit to the Tower, long days
in the Museum and the art galleries, for had they not, each
and all, in one form or another, the genuine Kensington
craze? They could not leave out any of the more common
things, like a drive to Richmond Hill or an afternoon at the
“Zoo.” They must go to Stoke Pogis and recite the elegy
in the churchyard where Gray wrote it. They must have
their day at Windsor, with its chance of seeing the queen
driving in the park, and the visit to Sydenham’s Crystal
Palace, and the afternoon at Hampton Court. They must
stroll down by Hyde Park corner and see fashionable London
dragging monotonously around the drive, or prancing
on horseback through Rotten Row. They must visit the
Parliament houses, and find many a still hour to linger and
dream within the walls of the wonderful old Westminster
Abbey, that is of itself worth crossing an ocean to see.
It is not for Wesley’s <i>grave</i> alone that we go to the
City-road Chapel, or for the grave of Watts that we enter
the Bunhill Fields. It is not the <i>tombs</i> of the poets, statesmen
and martyrs that hold our attention long, but we seek
in the living of to-day for the spirit that animated the great,
now dead; and eyes and ears alike are open to see and hear
the indications of growth in the noblest things. It matters
little that we see only the outside of Buckingham and St.
James. There are fairer palaces in London than those of
her princes, and to these, her edifices devoted to the alleviation
of human suffering and the advancement of human
progress, we turn with never-tiring interest and zeal.
In this class stand her colleges and hospitals and asylums,
her charitable organizations of every sort. London gives
yearly in food and clothing, and in the relief of disease, over
thirteen millions of dollars, to say nothing of a million
more given privately by individuals. For educational and
religious purposes she spends seven millions more, and yet
the city is filled in certain localities with the most wretched
of all citizens, the poor who are too far down to care to be
lifted up.</p>

<p>We passed delightful days in visiting some of the oldest
as well as some of the newest of the institutions of learning
or charity. Among the former the famous old St. Peter’s
College, founded as “a publique schoole for grammar, rethoricke
and poetrie,” and the Charter House School, of which
Wesley says, “I owed my health and long life to the
faithfulness with which I obeyed my father’s injunction to
run around the Charter House playing-green three times
every morning,” and the blue-coat school, where the boys
dressed in blue coat, yellow petticoat and stockings, and red
leather girdle around the waist, seemed to have stepped
down from the sixteenth century. Blue was originally a
color only worn by dependents, and never by gentlemen,
until after its use in the uniform of the British navy. In
striking contrast to these we found Girton and the Wesleyan
Normal College, for the training of teachers and the
teaching of children. In another line of instruction the
Government School of Design, at South Kensington, is
doing a most interesting work. One feature of its service to
the people is well worthy of imitation. Its library is rich
in illustrated works, and these are open for the use, not only
of artists, but of every poor working man or woman, at the
price of one penny a volume. From this school large additions
have been made to house decorators, designers and
draughtsmen for the various manufactures and trades. All
the collections of the wonderful museums of Kensington
are intended to subserve the purpose of the school, of which
branches have been formed in various manufacturing districts
throughout England.</p>

<p>No philanthropic work in London will be more likely to
attract the attention of Americans, than that done by the
Peabody fund in the construction of the model lodging
houses, where three rooms, comfortable and clean, can be
hired for five shillings a week. The buildings in the various
districts where they have already been erected are five
stories in height, well lighted, well ventilated, and calculated
in every way to make desirable homes for the very
poor. Since the gift of Mr. Peabody, the corporation of
London has given land and six hundred thousand dollars
for the erection of model dwellings for the working people.
Before them in this benevolent work has been the Baroness
Burdett-Couts, whose heart has seemed to be as large as her
purse. A morning spent in exploring the vicinity of Columbia
Square Market showed us her four large blocks of neat
houses surrounding a court all occupied now by a clean, orderly
class of people. The adjoining market, built to accommodate
the neighborhood on the site of the old “dust
heap” was also her work. The place was one of the most
filthy and pestilential haunts of vice and degradation in the
city of London. Its refuse heaps were almost as high as its
hovels, and foulness, moral and physical, made the spot a
breeding place of disease to body and soul. These are only
instances of what may be done, of what must be done, indeed,
if cities like those of England and America are ever
to be lifted from the pauperism that destroys soul and
body alike. And the traveler, who makes his journey
without securing a knowledge of what is stirring in other
countries to solve the problem of helping people to help
themselves, misses both the truth as to the realities of human
conditions and the inspiration that comes from seeing
what has been already done. The great consideration is
time, which is always and everywhere too short. Our quartette
labored faithfully and well, but, like other travelers,
saw once what they wanted to see a dozen times, heard their
favorite music in snatches and their favorite preachers
sometimes once and sometimes not at all. They crowded
ten objects of interest into the time fairly due to one, and
left London with the feeling of a hungry man at a railway
station whose bell rings just as he has taken the first bite of
his dinner.</p>

<p>“Who was it, in Mother Goose, that ‘whipped his children
and made them dance out of Ireland into France?’”
asks the scribe of the quartette, lifting her pen with a characteristic
motion that betrays an inclination to put it behind
her ear. “’Twasn’t anybody,” answers the scholar, gruffly,
who feels a coming talk in the air and does not like to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
disturbed at his book. “Yes, it was!” persists the scribe,
“and whoever he was, the chief is just like him. Here he is
fairly lashing us about Londontown to drive us over to
France.” Behind his newspaper the chief smiles. “You
will be glad I hastened you, when once you are there out of
this wretched fog.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t had half enough of London.”</p>

<p>“True, and you never would have enough. It’s a place to
<i>live</i> in, not to visit!”</p>

<p>“Then I’d like to live on, straight along.”</p>

<p>“Very good! The rest of us must go around the world.”</p>

<p>“But we have made a mistake! no one could do it in the
time we have set.”</p>

<p>“A common experience, again, sister,” said the chief, who,
having the times and seasons in his hands, and having been
indulgent enough to stay on from day to day, was at last in
a somewhat inexorable mood.</p>

<p>And though there was still some coaxing to stay, one
bright morning found us fairly started on our dance “out
of England into France.”</p>

<p>The morning of our departure is fine; the air delicious,
a fresh breeze blowing from the west. A good course of
packing lasting well into the night added physical weariness
to the rather thin layer of mental fatigue consequent on
keeping a journal, and therefore London seems less attractive
than it did. If it were not for a faint foreboding sense
that the Channel lies just before, we could even begin to be
glad that the metropolis is left behind. The chief does not
say, “I told you so” as he sees our spirits rise, but then
the chief is—not a woman. It is soon over,—the three
hours of grace that it takes us to whirl down to Folkestone,
and it’s three hours of pleasure, except the last few minutes
when we catch the mocking toss of the saucy white-caps on
the waves. We rejoiced this morning in the wind that
scattered the London fog, but now we know how felt Lot’s
wife in that dire day of Sodom. Bravely as possible we
march to our fate. The wicked scribe can not forbear asking
the chief whose white cheeks contradict his defiant expression,
if he is glad he “made her dance.” We hear people
in various stages of resistance saying “this is not bad;
that the channel is often worse.” “No doubt! no doubt!”
but we do not care to discuss it, and the photographs of the
quartette would show them seated lugubriously, with their
backs to the smoke-stack, not coldly unsocial, but each
meditating profoundly on topics that are not to the others
of the slightest concern. They are meditating only, and,
meantime that smoke-stack rides up into the air, and they
with it, and it fairly seems to be intoxicated at its upper
end, yet they hold fast to it and to each other down below;
and then it changes its mind and seems to go down and
down, until they feel as if they were in the fast diminishing
turret of a monitor, and that the bottom is dropping out
of the depth of the sea.</p>

<p>And yet they live, and revive, and when the boat touches
Boulogne-sur-Mer, are ready for the French-English table
d’hôte served at the railway restaurant, and the scribe at
least is ready for a walk to the heights above the town, “just
to look back to old England, you know,” and see what Napoleon
saw when he gathered his army of nearly two hundred
thousand men along this coast, and filled the harbor
with his ships, and watched and waited his chance to go
over and take the British bull by the horns.</p>

<p>“Think, sister, how the fate of the nations might have
been changed, if only Napoleon had gone”—says the chief
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Now, brother, if you are going to meditate, or moralize,
we shall miss the train,” answers the scribe.</p>

<p>He looks at her gravely. “I am afraid,” he says under
his breath, “that my next duty will be to train that miss.”</p>

<h2><a name="THRIFT" id="THRIFT">THRIFT.</a></h2>
<hr class='shorter' />
<p class='center'>By CHARLES KINGSLEY.</p>
<hr class='shorter' />

<p class='center'><i>A Lecture for Women.</i></p>


<p>Consider that word thrift. If you will look at Dr. Johnson’s
Dictionary, or if you know your Shakspere, you will
see that thrift signified originally profits, gain, riches gotten—in
a word, the marks of a man’s thriving.</p>

<p>How, then, did the word thrift get to mean parsimony,
frugality, the opposite of waste? Just in the same way as
economy—which, first, of course, meant the management
of a household—got to mean also the opposite of waste.</p>

<p>It was found that in commerce, in husbandry, in any process,
in fact, men throve in proportion as they saved their
capital, their material, their force.</p>

<p>Now this is a great law which runs through life; one of
those laws of nature—call them, rather, laws of God—which
apply not merely to political economy, to commerce, and to
mechanics; but to physiology, to society; to the intellect,
to the heart, of every person in this room.</p>

<p>The secret of thriving is thrift; saving of force; to get as
much work as possible done with the least expenditure of
power, the least jar and obstruction, the least wear and tear.</p>

<p>And the secret of thrift is knowledge. In proportion as
you know the laws and nature of a subject, you will be able
to work at it easily, surely, rapidly, successfully; instead of
wasting your money or your energies in mistaken schemes,
irregular efforts, which end in disappointment and exhaustion.</p>

<p>The secret of thrift, I say, is knowledge. The more you
know, the more you can save yourself and that which belongs
to you; and can do more work with less effort.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the laws of commercial credit, we all know,
saves capital, enabling a less capital to do the work of a
greater. Knowledge of the electric telegraph saves time;
knowledge of writing saves human speech and locomotion;
knowledge of domestic economy saves income; knowledge of
sanitary laws saves health and life; knowledge of the laws
of the intellect saves wear and tear of brain; and knowledge
of the laws of the spirit—what does it not save?</p>

<p>A well-educated moral sense, a well-regulated character,
saves from idleness and ennui, alternating with sentimentality
and excitement, those tender emotions, those deeper
passions, those nobler aspirations of humanity, which are
the heritage of the woman far more than of the man; and
which are potent in her, for evil or for good, in proportion
as they are left to run wild and undisciplined, or are trained
and developed into graceful, harmonious, self-restraining
strength, beautiful in themselves, and a blessing to all who
come under their influence.</p>

<p>What, therefore, I recommend to ladies in this lecture is
thrift; thrift of themselves and of their own powers: and
knowledge as the parent of thrift.</p>

<p>“To fit women for the more enlightened performance of
their special duties;” to help them towards learning how to
do better what we doubt not they are already doing well;
is, I honestly believe, the only object of the promoters of this
scheme.</p>

<p>Let us see now how some of these special duties can be
better performed by help of a little enlightenment as to
the laws which regulate them.</p>

<p>Now, no man will deny—certainly no man who is past
forty-five, and whose digestion is beginning to quail before
the lumps of beef and mutton which are the boast of a well-regulated
kitchen, and to prefer, with Justice Shallow, and,
I presume, Sir John Falstaff also, “any pretty little tiny kickshaws”—no
man, I say, who has reached that age, but will
feel it a practical comfort to him to know that the young ladies
of his family are at all events good cooks; and understand,
as the French do, thrift in the matter of food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Neither will any parent who wishes, naturally enough,
that his daughters should cost him as little as possible; and
wishes, naturally enough also, that they should be as well
dressed as possible, deny that it would be a good thing for
them to be practical milliners and mantua-makers; and, by
making their own clothes gracefully and well, exercise thrift
in clothing.</p>

<p>But, beside this thrift in clothing, I am not alone, I believe,
in wishing for some thrift in the energy which produces
it. Labor misapplied, you will agree, is labor wasted;
and as dress, I presume, is intended to adorn the person of
the wearer, the making a dress which only disfigures her
may be considered as a plain case of waste. It would be impertinent
in me to go into any details: but it is impossible to
walk about the streets now without passing young people
who must be under a deep delusion as to the success of their
own toilette. Instead of graceful and noble simplicity of
form, instead of combinations of color at once rich and delicate,
because in accordance with the chromatic laws of nature,
one meets with phenomena more and more painful to
the eye, and startling to common sense, till one would be
hardly more astonished, and certainly hardly more shocked,
if in a year or two one should pass some one going about
like a Chinese lady, with pinched feet, or like a savage of
the Amazons, with a wooden bung through her lower lip.
It is easy to complain of these monstrosities: but impossible
to cure them, it seems to me, without an education of the
taste, an education in those laws of nature which produce
beauty in form and beauty in color. For that cause of these
failures lies in want of education is patent. They are most
common in—I had almost said they are confined to—those
classes of well-to-do persons who are the least educated;
who have no standard of taste of their own; and who do not
acquire any from cultivated friends and relations: who, in
consequence, dress themselves blindly according to what
they conceive to be Paris fashions, conveyed at third-hand
through an equally uneducated dressmaker; in innocent
ignorance of the fact—for fact I believe it to be—that Paris
fashions are invented now not in the least for the sake of
beauty, but for the sake of producing, through variety, increased
expenditure, and thereby increased employment;
according to the strange system which now prevails in
France of compelling, if not prosperity, at least the signs of
it; and like schoolboys before a holiday, nailing up the
head of the weather glass to insure fine weather.</p>

<p>Let the ladies educate themselves in those laws of beauty
which are as eternal as any other of nature’s laws; which
may be seen fulfilled, as Mr. Ruskin tells us, so eloquently
in every flower and every leaf, in sweeping down and rippling
wave: and they will be able to invent graceful and
economical dresses for themselves, without importing tawdry
and expensive ugliness from France.</p>

<p>Let me now go a step further, and ask you to consider
this.—There are now a vast number, and an increasing number,
of young women who, from various circumstances
which we all know, must in after life be either the mistresses
of their own fortunes, or the earners of their own bread.
And to do that wisely and well, they must be more or less
women of business; and to be women of business, they must
know something of the meaning of the words capital, profit,
price, value, labor, wages, and of the relations between those
two last. In a word, they must know a little political economy.
Nay, I sometimes think that the mistress of every
household might find, not only thrift of money, but thrift of
brain; freedom from mistakes, anxieties, worries of many
kinds, all of which eat out the health as well as the heart,
by a little sound knowledge of the principles of political
economy.</p>

<p>When we consider that every mistress of a household is
continually buying, if not selling; that she is continually
hiring and employing labor in the form of servants; and
very often, into the bargain, keeping her husband’s accounts:
I cannot but think that her hard-worked brain might
be clearer, and her hard-tried desire to do her duty by every
subject in her little kingdom, might be more easily satisfied,
had she read something of what Mr. John Stuart Mill has
written, especially on the duties of employer and employed.
A capitalist, a commercialist, an employer of labor, and an
accountant—every mistress of a household is all these,
whether she likes it or not; and it would be surely well for
her, in so very complicated a state of society as this, not to
trust merely to that mother-wit, that intuitive sagacity and
innate power of ruling her fellow-creatures, which carries
women so nobly through their work in simpler and less
civilized societies.</p>

<p>And here I stop to answer those who may say—as I have
heard it said—that a woman’s intellect is not fit for business;
that when a woman takes to business, she is apt to do it ill,
and unpleasantly likewise: to be more suspicious, more irritable,
more grasping, more unreasonable, than regular
men of business would be: that—as I have heard it put—“a
woman does not fight fair.” The answer is simple. That
a woman’s intellect is eminently fitted for business is proved
by the enormous amount of business she gets through without
any special training for it: but those faults in a woman
of which some men complain are simply the results of her
not having had a special training. She does not know
the laws of business. She does not know the rules of the
game she is playing; and therefore she is playing it in the
dark, in fear and suspicion, apt to judge of questions on personal
grounds, often offending those with whom she has to
do, and oftener still making herself miserable over matters
of law or of business, on which a little sound knowledge
would set her head and her heart at rest.</p>

<p>When I have seen widows, having the care of children,
of a great household, of great estate, of a great business,
struggling heroically, and yet often mistakenly; blamed severely
for selfishness and ambition, while they were really
sacrificing themselves with the divine instinct of a mother
for their children’s interest: I have stood by with mingled
admiration and pity, and said to myself—“How nobly she
is doing the work without teaching! How much more nobly
would she have done it had she been taught! She is
now doing the work at the most enormous waste of energy
and of virtue: had she had knowledge, thrift would have
followed it; she would have done more work with far less
trouble. She will probably kill herself if she goes on: sound
knowledge would have saved her health, saved her heart,
saved her friends, and helped the very loved ones for whom
she labors, not always with success.”</p>

<p>A little political economy, therefore, will at least do no
harm to a woman; especially if she have to take care of herself
in after life; neither, I think, will she be much harmed
by some sound knowledge of another subject,—“Natural
philosophy, in its various branches, such as the chemistry
of common life, light, heat, electricity, etc., etc.”</p>

<p>A little knowledge of the laws of light, for instance, would
teach many women that by shutting themselves up day after
day, week after week, in darkened rooms, they are as
certainly committing a waste of health, destroying their vital
energy, and diseasing their brains, as if they were taking
so much poison the whole time.</p>

<p>For let me ask you, ladies, with all courtesy, but with all
earnestness—Are you aware of certain facts, of which every
excellent medical man is too well aware? Are you aware
that more human beings are killed every year by unnecessary
and preventable diseases than were killed at Waterloo
or at Sadowa? Are you aware that the great majority of
those victims are children? Are you aware that the diseases
which carry them off are for the most part such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
ought to be specially under the control of the women who
love them, pet them, educate them, and would in many
cases, if need be, lay down their lives for them? Are you
aware, again, of the vast amount of disease which, so both
wise mothers and wise doctors assure me, is engendered in
the sleeping-room from simple ignorance of the laws of ventilation,
and in the school-room likewise, from simple ignorance
of the laws of physiology? from an ignorance of
which I shall mention no other case here save one—that
too often from ignorance of signs of approaching disease, a
child is punished for what is called idleness, listlessness,
wilfulness, sulkiness; and punished, too, in the unwisest
way—by an increase of tasks and confinement to the house,
thus overtasking still more a brain already overtasked, and
depressing still more, by robbing it of oxygen and of exercise,
a system already depressed? Are you aware, I ask
again, of all this? I speak earnestly upon this point, because
I speak with experience. As a single instance: a medical
man, a friend of mine, passing by his own school-room,
heard one of his own little girls screaming and crying, and
went in. The governess, an excellent woman, but wholly
ignorant of the laws of physiology, complained that the child
of late had become obstinate and would not learn; and that
therefore she must punish her by keeping her indoors over
the unlearned lessons. The father, who knew that the child
was usually very good, looked at her carefully for a little
while; sent her out of the schoolroom; and then said, “That
child must not open a book for a month.” “If I had not acted
so,” he said to me, “I should have had that child dead of
brain disease within a year.”</p>

<p>Now, in the face of such facts as these, is it too much to ask
of mothers, sisters, aunts, nurses, governesses—all who may
be occupied in the care of children, especially of girls—that
they should study thrift of human health and human life,
by studying somewhat the laws of life and health? There
are books—I may say a whole literature of books—written
by scientific doctors on these matters, which
are in my mind far more important to the schoolroom than
half the trashy accomplishments, so-called, which are expected
to be known by governesses. But are they bought?
Are they even to be bought, from most country booksellers?
Ah, for a little knowledge of the laws to the neglect of
which is owing so much fearful disease, which if it does not
produce immediate death, too often leaves the constitution
impaired for years to come. Ah the waste of health and
strength in the young; the waste, too, of anxiety and misery
in those who love and tend them. How much of it
might be saved by a little rational education in those laws
of nature which are the will of God about the welfare of our
bodies, and which, therefore, we are as much bound to know
and to obey as we are bound to know and obey the spiritual
laws whereon depends the welfare of our souls.</p>

<p>Pardon me, ladies, if I have given a moment’s pain to any
one here: but I appeal to every medical man in the room
whether I have not spoken the truth; and having such an
opportunity as this, I felt that I must speak for the sake of
children, and of women likewise, or else for ever hereafter
hold my peace.</p>

<p>Let me pass on from this painful subject—for painful it
has been to me for many years—to a question of intellectual
thrift—by which I mean just now thrift of words; thrift of
truth; restraint of the tongue; accuracy and modesty in statement.</p>

<p>Mothers complain to me that girls are apt to be—not intentionally
untruthful—but exaggerative, prejudiced, incorrect,
in repeating a conversation or describing an event; and
that from this fault arise, as is to be expected, misunderstandings,
quarrels, rumors, slanders, scandals, and what
not.</p>

<p>Now, for this waste of words there is but one cure; and if
I be told that it is a natural fault of women; that they cannot
take the calm judicial view of matters which men boast,
and often boast most wrongly, that they can take; that under
the influence of hope, fear, delicate antipathy, honest moral
indignation, they will let their eyes and ears be governed
by their feelings; and see and hear only what they wish to
see and hear: I answer, that it is not for me as a man to start
such a theory; but that if it be true, it is an additional argument
for some education which will correct this supposed
natural defect. And I say deliberately that there is but one
sort of education which will correct it, one which will teach
young women to observe facts accurately, judge them calmly
and describe them carefully, without adding or distorting:
and that is, some training in natural science.</p>

<p>I beg you not to be startled: but if you are, then test the
truth of my theory by playing to-night at the game called
“Russian Scandal;” in which a story, repeated in secret by
one player to the other, comes out at the end of the game,
owing to the inaccurate and—forgive me if I say it—uneducated
brains through which it has passed, utterly unlike its
original; not only ludicrously maimed and distorted, but
often with the most fantastic addition of events, details,
names, dates, places, which each player will aver he received
from the player before him. I am afraid that too
much of the average gossip of every city, town and village
is little more than a game of “Russian Scandal;” with this
difference, that while one is but a game, the other is but too
mischievous earnest.</p>

<p>But now, if among your party there shall be an average
lawyer, medical man, or man of science, you will find that
he, and perhaps he alone, will be able to retail accurately
the story which has been told him. And why? Simply
because his mind has been trained to deal with facts; to ascertain
exactly what he does see or hear, and to imprint its
leading features strongly and clearly on his memory.</p>

<p>I could say much on this point: allow me at least to say
this: I verily believe that any young lady who would employ
some of her leisure time in collecting wild flowers, carefully
examining them, verifying them, and arranging them;
or who would in her summer trip to the sea-coast do the
same by the common objects of the shore, instead of wasting
her holiday, as one sees hundreds doing, in lounging on
benches on the esplanade, reading worthless novels, and
criticising dresses—that such a young lady, I say, would not
only open her own mind to a world of wonder, beauty, and
wisdom, which, if it did not make her a more reverent and
pious soul, she can not be the woman which I take her for
granted she is; but would save herself from the habit—I had
almost said the necessity—of gossip; because she would
have things to think of and not merely persons; facts instead
of fancies; while she would acquire something of accuracy,
of patience, of methodical observation and judgment,
which would stand her in good stead in the events of daily
life and increase her power of bridling her tongue and her imagination.
“God is in heaven, and thou upon earth; therefore
let thy words be few;” is the lesson which those are
learning all day long who study the works of God with reverent
accuracy, lest by misrepresenting them they should
be tempted to say that God has done that which He has not;
and in that wholesome discipline I long that women as well
as men should share.</p>

<p>And now I come to a thrift of the highest kind, as contrasted
with a waste the most deplorable and ruinous of all;
thrift of those faculties which connect us with the unseen
and spiritual world; with humanity, with Christ, with God;
thrift of the immortal spirit. I am not going now to give
you a sermon on duty. You hear such, I doubt not, in
church every Sunday, far better than I can preach to you.
I am going to speak rather of thrift of the heart, thrift of
the emotions. How they are wasted in these days in reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
what are called sensation novels, all know but too well;
how good literature—all that the best hearts and intellects
among our forefathers have bequeathed to us—is neglected
for light fiction, the reading of which is, as a lady well said,
“the worst form of intemperance—dram-drinking and
opium-eating, intellectual and moral.”</p>

<p>I know that the young will delight—they have delighted
in all ages, and will to the end of time—in fictions which
deal with that “oldest tale which is forever new.” Novels
will be read: but that is all the more reason why women
should be trained, by the perusal of a higher, broader,
deeper literature, to distinguish the good novel from the
bad, the moral from the immoral, the noble from the base,
the true work of art from the sham which hides its shallowness
and vulgarity under a tangled plot and melodramatic
situations. She should learn—and that she can only learn
by cultivation—to discern with joy, and drink in with reverence,
the good, the beautiful, and the true; and to turn
with the fine scorn of a pure and strong womanhood from
the bad, the ugly, and the false.</p>

<p>And if any parent should be inclined to reply—“Why lay
so much stress upon educating a girl in good literature? Is
it not far more important to make our daughters read religious
books?” I answer—of course it is. I take for granted
that that is done in a Christian land. But I beg you to
recollect that there are books and books; and that in these
days of a free press it is impossible, in the long run, to prevent
girls reading books of very different shades of opinion,
and very different religious worth. It may be, therefore, of
the very highest importance to a girl to have her intellect,
her taste, her emotions, her moral sense, in a word, her
whole womanhood, so cultivated and regulated that she
shall herself be able to discern the true from the false, the
orthodox from the unorthodox, the truly devout from the
merely sentimental, the gospel from its counterfeits.</p>

<p>I should have thought that there never had been since the
Reformation, a crisis at which young women required more
careful cultivation on these matters; if at least they are to
be saved from making themselves and their families miserable;
and from ending—as I have known too many end—with
broken hearts, broken brains, broken health, and an
early grave.</p>

<p>Take warning by what you see abroad. In every country
where the women are uneducated, unoccupied; where their
only literature is French novels or translations of them—in
every one of those countries the women, even to the
highest, are the slaves of superstition, and the puppets of
priests. In proportion as, in certain other countries—notably,
I will say, in Scotland—the women are highly educated,
family life and family secrets are sacred, and the woman
owns allegiance and devotion to no confessor or director,
but to her own husband or to her own family.</p>

<p>I say plainly, that if any parents wish their daughters to
succumb at last to some quackery or superstition, whether
calling itself scientific, or calling itself religious—and there
are too many of both just now—they can not more certainly
effect their purpose than by allowing her to grow up ignorant,
frivolous, luxurious, vain; with her emotions excited,
but not satisfied, by the reading of foolish and even immoral
novels.</p>

<p>In such a case the more delicate and graceful the organization,
the more noble and earnest the nature, which has
been neglected, the more certain it is—I know too well what
I am saying—to go astray.</p>

<p>The time of depression, disappointment, vacuity, all but
despair, must come. The immortal spirit, finding no
healthy satisfaction for its highest aspirations, is but too likely
to betake itself to an unhealthy and exciting superstition.
Ashamed of its own long self-indulgence, it is but too likely
to flee from itself into a morbid asceticism. Not having
been taught its God-given and natural duties in the world,
it is but too likely to betake itself, from the mere craving
for action, to self-invented and unnatural duties out of the
world. Ignorant of true science, yet craving to understand
the wonders of nature and of spirit, it is but too likely to betake
itself to non-science—nonsense as it is usually called—whether
of spirit-rapping and mesmerism, or miraculous
relics and winking pictures. Longing for guidance and
teaching, and never having been taught to guide and teach
itself, it is but too likely to deliver itself up in self-despair to
the guidance and teaching of those who, whether they be
quacks or fanatics, look on uneducated women as their natural
prey.</p>

<p>One word more, and I have done. Let me ask women to
educate themselves, not for their own sakes merely, but for
the sake of others. For whether they will or not, they must
educate others. I do not speak merely of those who may
be engaged in the work of direct teaching; that they ought
to be well taught themselves, who can doubt? I speak of
those—and in so doing I speak of every woman, young and
old—who exercises as wife, as mother, as aunt, as sister, or
as friend, an influence, indirect it may be, and unconscious,
but still potent and practical, on the minds and characters
of those about them, especially of men. How potent and
practical that influence is, those know best who know most
of the world and most of human nature. There are those
who consider—and I agree with them—that the education
of boys under twelve years ought to be entrusted as much
as possible to women. Let me ask—of what period of youth
and manhood does not the same hold true? I pity the ignorance
and conceit of the man who fancies that he has nothing
left to learn from cultivated women.</p>

<p>Surely that is woman’s calling—to teach man: and to
teach him what? To teach him, after all, that his calling is
the same as hers, if he will but see the things which belong
to his peace. To temper his fiercer, coarser, more self-assertive
nature, by the contact of her gentleness, purity, self-sacrifice.
To make him see that not by blare of trumpets,
not by noise, wrath, greed, ambition, intrigue, puffery, is
good and lasting work to be done on earth: but by wise self-distrust,
by silent labor, by lofty self-control, by that charity
which hopeth all things, believeth all things, endureth all
things; by such an example, in short, as women now in tens
of thousands set to those around them; such as they will
show more and more, the more their whole womanhood is
educated to employ its powers without waste and without
haste in harmonious unity. Let the woman begin in girlhood,
if such be her happy lot—to quote the words of a great
poet, a great philosopher, and a great Churchman, William
Wordsworth—let her begin, I say—</p>

<p class='center'>By J. H. VINCENT, D. D., <span class="smcap">Superintendent of Instruction</span>, C. L. S. C.</p>


<p>The Sunday Readings of the January and February numbers
constitute the “required” reading on “Bible and Religious
History and Literature.” If now and then you consider
the selections “a little too long,” read them carefully
for your profit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the Sabbaths of January and February we read outlines
of Bible History principally from the abridgement by
Dr. Collier. It will be well (although it is not required) also
to read and study the outline lessons in the History of the
Bible and in Bible History, as given in Chautauqua Text-Book
No. 36, “Assembly Bible Outlines,” pages 7-37.
Price of Chautauqua Text-Book No. 36, only ten cents.</p>

<p>The people who most need the ministry of the C. L. S. C.
are not likely to take it up at first, and therefore those who
appreciate its advantages should seek out persons likely to
be profited by it. Think over your list of acquaintances,
rich and poor, people of wealth and people engrossed with
business or domestic care. Go with personal explanations
and appeals and induce them to join the Circle, or to take
up some part of its work, the reading of one book, or the
reading of a special course, like the Bryant or the Shakspere
course.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I want to call your attention to a valuable book for every
student’s table—“Roget’s Thesaurus.” It enables one to
find a whole family of words by knowing one of them. The
classification is well nigh perfect. Phrases, as well as
words, are included in the list. For example, look into the
index for the word “circle.” Your attention is called at
once to paragraph 181, which gives synonymous words of
circle, as defining a “region:” sphere, ground, soil, area,
realm, hemisphere, quarter, district, beat, orb, circuit, circle;
pale; compartment, department; domain, tract, territory,
country, canton, county, shire, province, <i>arrondissement</i>,
parish, township, <i>commune</i>, ward, wapentake, hundred,
riding; principality, duchy, kingdom, etc. Or we
turn to the word circle, as “form,” in paragraph 247, where
we have: circle, circlet, ring, areola, hoop, roundlet, <i>annulus</i>,
annulet, bracelet, armlet; ringlet; eye, loop, wheel;
cycle, orb, orbit, rundle, zone, belt, <i>cordon</i>, band; sash, girdle,
cestus, cincture, baldric, fillet, <i>fascia</i>, wreath, garland;
crown, corona, coronet, chaplet, snood, necklace, collar;
noose, lasso. Or take the word circle as a “party,” paragraph
712, where we find: party, side, faction, denomination,
communion, set, crew, band, horde, posse, phalanx;
family, clan, etc., etc.; community, body, fellowship, sodality,
solidarity; confraternity; brotherhood, sisterhood,
etc., etc., and so on through one thousand paragraphs, filling
429 pages, and then followed by a four-columned index
on each page for 271 more pages. The book is indeed a
treasury of the English language. Price, sent to members
of the C. L. S. C., $1.60.</p>

<p>The Cincinnati local circle has great enterprise. It announces
a third annual course of free lectures for the coming
winter. Our correspondent, Miss Eleanor C. O’Connell,
writes: “We are now planning for the organization of
a branch ‘Society of the Hall in the Grove,’ for, besides
having an alumnal meeting, it is our desire that next year,
and each succeeding one, the older graduates shall give in
October a reception to the last graduating class, and thus,
by welcoming them into this fraternity, help keep up their
interest in the Circle. I hope that when you come we will
have a good report to make concerning ’82 welcoming those
of this year.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Have you put our “university property” in order? Have
you a cozy corner in your house belonging to the C. L. S. C.?
Is the “dormitory” well ventilated? Is the food in the
“refectory” healthful? Are the “hours of reading” regularly
observed?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such words as these are refreshing: “Though only a
two-year-old Chautauquan, I feel that these two years have
been richer and more valuable to me than twice their number
before. They have indeed changed the whole tenor of
my life. Next year I expect to attend Michigan University
as a result of the work of the C. L. S. C. I feel that whatever
may be the degree of usefulness which I hope to
reach, it will be owing to the inspiration received from my
present course of reading.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While members of the C. L. S. C. should read the whole
series of books prescribed, each member <i>should select one
book to which he is to give especial attention</i>. The others
are books for outlook; this is a book for mental discipline.
He must master it, drill himself on it, study it critically,
doing with it what, if he had the time, he would do with
every book of the course.</p>

<p>As far as practicable, follow the prescribed order of the
reading, taking up each month the work prescribed for
that month. There is no law of the Medes and Persians
about it, but the work will be very much more satisfactorily
done where this rule is observed. It is always easier to
make reports, and fill out the memoranda, etc., when the
work is performed in the prescribed order.</p>

<p>I suggest to all students the value of much conversation
and council in the departments of study. Is there not
some teacher or other specialist in your community who
would be glad occasionally to give you helpful hints in history,
or other branch of study? Is there not, for example,
some one who takes a special interest in geology, and who,
during the months devoted to this study, would be glad to
guide you to a more practical knowledge than you can get
from mere books? Learn to utilize the talent of your community.
Ask questions. Do not be ashamed to betray ignorance.
State your opinions. What if you make a mistake?
You will not be likely to make it a second time.
The introduction into your life of casual conversations on
useful subjects will give both strength and dignity to your
life. Watch therefore the people of your community; pick
out those who know and can help. Get help out of them.
They will delight to serve you, and the service will do both
them and you great good.</p>

<p>Our friend, Miss Myrtie C. Hudson, from California, a
graduate of the Class of 1882, has entered Michigan University,
at Ann Arbor. She reports meetings of the students’
association. She says: “On Sunday morning the
hall was filled for the opening prayer-meeting, and there
was manifested a working Christian spirit which surprised
and delighted me. I believe one can grow in grace in such
a school. The crucial test of character will there be developed.
The five o’clock quiet hour on Sabbath afternoon is
growing very dear to me. That beautiful suggestion is one
of the many things for which I can never thank you
enough. If the hours help all the members as they do me,
they are no doubt a power in the Circle. I am already
looking forward to that time as the best in all the week.
A portion of the time I spend in preparing Bible readings
on themes suggested at Chautauqua, beginning with ‘God
in Nature,’ with Romans i: 19, 20 for the key. I shall
always look lovingly back to the weeks I spent at Chautauqua.
They were wonderful weeks, and I lived more in
them than in as many years before.”</p>

<p>There is strong temptation to take substitutes for the
regular books. You have a great cyclopædia, and prefer to
read articles on the appointed subject rather than to take
up the book required. Or, you have some other history, or
other scientific treatise. In order to economize, I have allowed
substitutes. Comparatively few of our students have
used them. It is much more pleasant for all members of
the C. L. S. C. to travel one way. The sympathy of the
members is increased by such unity. The reading of
Green’s “Short History of the English People,” and Merrivale’s
“Rome,” bound together by very strong cords the
members of the Circle. While there may be other valuable
books, we think that the “required” books are the best,
and we desire our members as far as practicable to use them.</p>

<p>Edward A. Spring, sculptor, who has charge of the clay-modeling
department, at Chautauqua, lingered for several
weeks after the close of the Assembly the past season. He
studied the old trees in St. Paul’s Grove, measuring them
carefully, and also numbered them. He finds twelve
maples, five beeches, one butternut, and one hemlock.
“The largest maple, No. 6,” he says, “is nearly eight feet
in circumference. It stands in front of the Hall. A butternut,
No. 8, is a grand old tree, and full of nuts this year;
but it leans very much toward the hemlock, and can hardly
last long without some skillful forestry work. All the
trees, except Nos. 2 and 9, are too large to reach around
with my arms. No. 13 is one of the finest trees on the
whole grounds—a very symmetrical tulip on the west side
of Cookman Avenue.” He adds, “I had been all about the
Grove many times, but now that I have held each one of
these giants of the old forest clasped in my arms, I feel toward
each as if I had said farewell to a dear friend. For
five Sundays the setting sun has lighted a little band of
friends in the Hall of Philosophy—five little gatherings,
where a lovely spirit prevailed, and I think all there present
will long remember it. Dr. Eaton and Mr. Martin have
led the service, which took the form of devotional expression,</p>

<p class='center'>
‘A song of service, of faith, of praise;’<br />
</p>

<p class='unindent'>with frequent allusions to our book-mates of the great
Circle at whose center we were met. Several times each
one in turn repeated a verse of Scripture; and, day before
yesterday, upon closing, we joined hands and closed the
circle, repeating in concert the three mottoes of the C. L. S.
C. Now, I started out to tell you of these meetings with
an express purpose, namely, to urge the desirableness of
securing a sunset belt from the Hall of Philosophy, so that
no intervening structures shall cut off this glorifying of the
maples at the hour of the Round-Table, and other favored
and favorite gatherings.”</p>

<p><i>New England.</i>—I am astonished at the wonderful system
and workings of the C. L. S. C. It seems to me that this
must be one of the most active agents for good extant, and
its origination ought surely to be counted among the most
progressive educational forces of the day. It was with some

<p><i>Massachusetts (Williamstown).</i>—One year ago I began the
Chautauqua course in connection with my regular college
duties. While for me, a great part of the work was a review,
I found that it served to clinch and make fast my previous
knowledge of the subjects taken up, and also gave
me much information that was new and not to be obtained
in my college course. I have just entered on my senior
year, and although I am very busy, I shall keep up my C.
L. S. C. work, believing that any time I can take to devote
to that, will be spent to the best possible advantage. To
one who has the advantages of a college education the C. L.
S. C. course furnishes a valuable auxiliary and material
aid, while to those denied this advantage, it furnishes a
means of education surely second to none, save perhaps the
few best colleges. My purpose is to graduate and then to
pursue some of the extra courses as I have time. With best
wishes for the success of the “People’s College,” and of
every true Chautauquan, I am yours, respectfully, etc.</p>

<p><i>Massachusetts.</i>—I have nearly all of last year’s books to

never leaving my room unless carried out, and unable to sit

long, weary years, reading, and listening to reading, has
been the one great pleasure left me. Having my attention
directed, a few months since, to the list of required readings
for the C. L. S. C., the thought presented itself to me
that, in place of desultory reading, I might substitute a
regular course, as I think there are but few days pass when
I do not read at least forty minutes, still I dare not pledge
myself to even that length of time regularly, and can only
promise to do the best I can.</p>

<p><i>Illinois.</i>—For six weeks I have been very sick. Through
it all I have continued my reading. Of how much value the
past year’s reading has been to me it would be impossible
to tell. But there are books in the library that have never
been opened by me before, thinking they were too deep or
dry until the beautiful “Mosaics,” printed in that valuable
paper, “<span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>,” touched the spring of curiosity

<p><i>New York.</i>—A mother, whose daughter (also a member of

gem, weighted with meaning in the illustrations; and now
I only regret that I was not more interested in the diploma,
and had it on regular parchment. My husband was pleased
with it, and wished me to have it framed and hung beside
my son’s and daughter’s—the one from Harvard, the other
from Fort Edward Institute. My son, who is an enthusiastic
educator, sent his congratulations, saying: ‘Not many
have received a diploma after being fifty-five years of age.’
But what afforded us all increased pleasure was the mistake
of one of the initials, my own name being C. W. C., and
my daughter’s being C. M. C. The name in the diploma is
Mrs. C. M. C., so like the blending of our tastes and life
pursuits. My son says: ‘The error of initials has increased
the value of the diploma;’ and all of us so consider it.
Well, she had commenced on the fourth year, and with
quivering lip expressed a hope that she should live to finish
the course. To her belongs the merit of inspiring her
mother and others in this place, and her influence will continue.
How appropriate that she shares in the diploma
that I doubly value for her sake!”</p>

<p><i>California.</i>—With my three little children and quite an

than I can express, though I am not at all satisfied with my
year’s work. It troubles me sometimes to remember what
I have read. I am very anxious to take up the Greek course.
I have been trying to get some of my neighbors interested
in the C. L. S. C., but do not succeed, so I am plodding on
alone. I think you are doing a noble work, and the end is

and we would not take anything for what we learned.
Mother would often ask, “Well, how much do you remember
of all you read?” I often thought it was like the Centennial—we
were there a week. Of course we can’t remember
half we saw, and yet we have a pretty good idea of
what was there, and what we saw; enough to make it a
pleasure and a profit to think of. And so about the books
we read. Perhaps we couldn’t answer one question in ten
you’d ask us in Roman history, and yet we have a distinct
idea of the way the people lived, of the characters of Julius
Cæsar, Sulla, Nero, etc. We have a beautiful cat named
Pericles, who was a kitten when we were reading history of
Greece; and we had one named Antonius when reading Roman
history, but he wasn’t nice, and we gave him away.</p>

<p><i>Maryland.</i>—One of the most charming domestic scenes is
reported to us from the “Bird’s Nest,” in Maryland, where
there are several members of the Circle. A good woman,
who is the light of the house, writes: There have been days
when I could not study at all, but the shells that I was able
to gather as I stood on the shore, helped me to listen to the
waves as they came in from the other side of the great sea
of knowledge, from away back before the coming of Christ.
And I have learned that there is no god like our God, for he
knoweth that we have need of this mind-furnishing. I feel
sure that the C. L. S. C. has come to be one of the corner-stones
in our home. Jesus Christ, I hope, is the chief corner-stone.
Does not our Bible tell us that “every wise
woman buildeth her house?” Does she wish to know how?
“Through wisdom is a house builded, and by understanding
is it established, and by knowledge shall the chambers be
filled with all precious and pleasant riches.” I pray God
that every mother may belong to the C. L. S. C. When I
began my studies in October last, I soon felt I wanted my
husband to study with me. Thus far in our married life
we had always gone hand in hand together. I felt almost
as if we were being separated. I did not urge the matter,
because I saw that he felt that for me it would be impracticable.
The more I studied, the more I felt it was right
for me to keep on; that I could help them all in the home
better by so doing. Last evening, after reading the <span class="smcap">Chautauqua
Herald</span> (we have taken it all through the course
this summer), my husband laid down the paper and said:
“My dear, I am going to join this Circle; and Nellie (turning
to our daughter), you must join it, too, and we will all
help each other in the home.” All my heart went out to
God in thankfulness. * * * Last Sabbath was my birthday,
and my two nieces and daughter told me on Saturday
evening that I must not go into the dining-room Sabbath
morning until the bell rang for breakfast. Accordingly,
when the bell sounded, my husband escorted me to the
dining-room. The table was beautiful with its linen, its
basket of pears, peaches, and grapes in the center, and the
lovely saucer bouquet at my plate. Just beside my chair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
was a flower stand that father had made for me, and each
shelf was laden with presents for me from the dear ones,
not excepting my honored, faithful, colored servant. In the
bay-window were the words, “Happy Birthday,” in phantom
letters. When we were seated at the table, my husband
asked a blessing. Each of us then recited a verse of Scripture,
as is our usual custom. Just then my father handed
my husband a paper, which he opened and read. It was a sweet
little poem which he had written, closing with the words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“In sooth no works of sophistry</div>

<p><i>Ohio.</i>—Since I began to study in the C. L. S. C., I have
spent a summer in England and Scotland. Thanks to you
and Green, I was thoroughly steeped in English history and
literature, which made every place alive with interest. At
Oxford did we not wander along the lovely Isis where Addison
loved to walk, to ponder, and study? and did we not
revel in a mild way under the solemn shade of the venerable
trees, and gaze with intense interest at the manuscripts
and books of the Bodleian Library? and did we not hear
Gray’s Elegy in that very country churchyard? Then, too,
we made a pilgrimage to Canterbury,</p>

<p class='center'>
“The holy blisful martir for to seeke.”<br />
</p>

<p class='unindent'>There were six of us, and we were all of one mind. We

which included a visit to unfrequented Ayr,</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class='unindent'>and to Kirk Alloway, where poor Tam saw such a bewitching
sight. The last weeks of the summer were spent in the
English lake district, and long shall I remember the wonderful
pictures seen from our windows at Keswick: mountains
blue and hazy, and again with wreaths of vapor creeping up
the sides and capping the summits, or perhaps clouds hanging
in pillowy masses over them; and there in the sunlight
was the Greta, rippling waves and leaping just as it enchanted
Southey, and if I had not known about him, it would
have been nothing to me. If there is a paradise upon earth,
it must be at Grasmere and Rydyl, sacred with the memory
of Wordsworth. There is nothing to disturb the serene,
charming place. We sat by the clear, noisy Rothay, and
wandered through Grasmere churchyard, where Wordsworth
is buried. Dorothy lies beside him. The clergyman
intoned the evening service in the church as if it were
a tedious affair, and we were glad to be through with it.
Maybe he did not think it worth while to be slow and solemn,
as there were only five worshippers. May it be your
good fortune some day to see the old creature known as
guide to the principal fall of Rydyl. As she painfully hobbled
along on her cane, she grew quite garrulous over her
recollections of the past. H. asked her whether she ever
read his poems. “Seeing him and knowing him,” said she,
“is a better memory than reading his poetry.” To the C.
L. S. C. is due much of the pleasure of the summer.
Through the C. L. S. C. I received the first impulse to study
systematically at home; and it is my desire to have my
gratitude take a substantial form. I remember the scholarships
you referred to that Commencement Day. Inclosed
you will find ten dollars, which is my contribution for such
a scholarship. It is my way to make acknowledgment of
what the C. L. S. C has done for me.</p>

<p><i>Ohio.</i>—The Madison Chautauqua Circle lost a valued
member, by the death of Mary E. Galpin, on October 8,
1882. In the summer of 1878 she visited Lake Chautauqua.
Having intellectual tastes, she soon became interested in
the founding of the “People’s College.” On her return
home, in her quiet and unobtrusive way, she endeavored to
enlarge the Chautauqua Circle by awakening an interest
among her young friends. In the summer of 1880 she visited
Chautauqua, and enjoyed the Round-Table talks within
the shade of the “Hall in the Grove,” and while watching the
first C. L. S. C. camp-fire, Mary’s zeal and enthusiasm seemed
to kindle anew. Those who have been closely associated
with her know of her unabated interest, and somewhat of
the disappointment she experienced in not being able to realize
her long-cherished hope of being at Chautauqua on
that memorable Commencement Day. In the providence
of God she was prevented from passing under the triumphal
arches at Chautauqua, but she was greatly gratified when
she received her diploma, and expressed her determination
to secure the white seal. “But it is not for man to direct
his steps.” A few weeks after, wearing the white rose of a
pure life unfolded by all-sufficient grace, and upheld by
filial devotion, without a murmur, with a smile on her face,
she passed through the golden gate into the heavenly city.</p>

<p>Berlin, Pennsylvania, is located in a beautiful valley,

enterprising, but favored with a moral and intelligent population.
We organized our circle in the latter part of October
and commenced our reading November 1st. Our membership
numbers twenty-two. We have elected a librarian,
hoping soon to need one. We do not appoint a leader for
the circle, but a conductor for each department of work—one
for geology, another for Greek history, etc. Having a
number of professional men in our circle, such as doctors,
ministers and teachers, we propose a division of labor, and
thus we shall do more thorough work. We will have one
regular meeting each month, and as many special meetings
as we shall find profitable. Memorial days will come under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>

While assembling a running conversation is kept up

general conversation to the special work of the evening. So
far this has consisted chiefly of a discussion of geology,
aided by the diagrams. Considerable interest has been
awakened on this subject. Usually we have had one or
more essays at each meeting, but have had none yet this
year. The questions for further study will hereafter form a
part of the evening’s work. We meet every two weeks on
Monday night, from house to house. There are two circles
here, one of ladies, who meet on Friday afternoon, and
ours, of both sexes. We have also a general organization.
A number of the other circle always meet with us. The
Pioneer Circle is composed almost entirely of teachers in
the public schools, and they must catch time when they can,
but they are enthusiastic workers.</p>

<p><i>Johnstown, N. Y.</i>—Our method of conducting C. L. S. C.
work is this: At each meeting, after the program of the
previous meeting has been carried out, the leader requests
one or two members to prepare essays on a certain part of
the work, one or two members to bring a stated number of
questions on a certain subject, another member to read a
short article from <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>. Very often the
leader asks for the opinion of various members of a character
or an article met with in the reading. At our last meeting
the circle authorized the secretary to appoint at each
meeting—which occurs each alternate week—a critic, also
what might be called an orthoëpist. We cannot inform you
as to the benefit to be derived from this feature of our circle,
as it is new to us.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Quincy, Michigan.</i>—Were mine a thousand voices; yea,
the voice of every Chautauquan who regards system and
order, who enjoys the pleasure and strength there is in feeling
they are each day and week going on with a large band
of faithful Chautauquans, I would say please go on in the
good old way of dividing the lessons of the month into
weekly installments. It is a real help to have the week’s
work laid out for us in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>. It greatly facilitates
the labor of the leader of the local circle. Our
local circle, which numbered about ten members last year,
has started out “boomingly” this year with about twenty, and
the prospect is good for still widening the circle. We have
weekly meetings. One, a most enthusiastic member, comes
five and a-half miles to attend the meetings. Our president
is a minister. He and his worthy wife take an active
part in the work. We also have the principal and preceptress
of our public schools among our active members. After
a general history and geology lesson we have essays on the
subject of the evening from the older members, that are inspiring
to the younger ones.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Northfield, Connecticut, local circle is situate in the
old “Mountain County,” Litchfield, where rocks are convenient
for geological study, and the pure atmosphere favors
astronomical observations. It numbers nine members, six
of whom are regular members of the C. L. S. C. All are
young people, and six are, or have been, school teachers.
Inasmuch as it is a new organization, with its method of
work tentative and liable to change, or displacement, on
further trial, its plan is only given because it may have a
suggestion for those who would not adopt it exactly. The
circle meets fortnightly, and on Friday evenings, so all the
teachers can be present. Topics, from the required reading,
are assigned in advance, and by lot. Then each member is
responsible for his or her topic, but he is allowed to present
it at the next meeting in the form of an essay, lecture, or
recitation, or he may come prepared to be questioned upon it
by the committee of instruction and the class generally.
Thus far the plan works well, stimulating thorough preparation
on the part of all, and furnishing all the work the
circle can well do in an evening. Any considerable increase
of members would of course make some modification of our
method necessary, and the reports of other circles in <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span> may reveal something so much better that
we may abandon our experimental ways entirely. We send
greeting to the whole C. L. S. C.</p>

<p><i>Gilroy, California.</i>—We organized in 1879 and ’80 a local
circle with about twenty-five members. In the study of
history, besides the regular lesson, some of the members
were appointed to read selections, and others to write short
sketches of principal characters whose names are found in our
lessons. The selections were mostly poems from Macaulay’s
Lays of Ancient Rome and Tennyson’s King Arthur. In
the study of biology, geology, etc., questions were distributed
to the class on slips of paper by a committee appointed
by the chair at the previous meeting. The questions and
answers were read at the next meeting. Sometimes topics
or subjects were given; the general divisions of the vegetable
kingdom, glacial formation, the orders of Greek and Roman
architecture, etc. Last year we were favored by having
Prof. Norton, of the State Normal School, for one of our
leaders. In the study of art we had the benefit of stereoscopic
views exhibited by the aid of a magic lantern, of the
ancient ruins and public buildings, and scenes of interest in
Egypt, Greece, and Italy. In the study of geology and
chemistry, the Professor gave us illustrative diagrams on
the blackboard, and chemical experiments illustrating volcanic
action, and various other phenomena resulting from
scientific investigation. This year we have taken “a new
departure.” We do not have a regular leader, as heretofore,
but the person occupying the chair appoints a successor for
the next meeting, who conducts the recitation, makes up
the order of work, and then appoints a successor for the next
meeting. Our plan of work is still the same as in former
years. Prof. Norton is still with us occasionally; also Miss
S. M. Severance, who has been a great help to the circle
since its organization, not only as an efficient teacher at the
regular meetings, but one to whom we could refer questions
of importance, her extensive and varied information enabling
her to be, as it were, a living encyclopedia for our
benefit.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of Mr. Wm. Price, a spacious room
in his residence has been put at our disposal, and herein we
hold our meetings every Monday evening, and examine one
another on the matters we have read during each preceding
week, and the answers form vital topics for discussion
of surpassing interest. But we are by no means selfish with
our highly prized acquirements, and our circle is greatly
honored by the leading Lyceum of this city, the management
of which has graciously requested us to take charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of the first half of their program. In response we send some
one of our circle in a representative capacity, to each meeting
to deliver a lecture upon one of the subjects of the course,
and we expect to take up all in due season. Already much
interest is awakened, and our circle promises to become
famous for its capable and willing workers for Christianity
and culture.</p>

<p><i>Holliston, Maine.</i>—Our local circle numbers forty members.
Our meetings are held monthly, and the program is
arranged by a committee of two, and announced a month in
advance. Synopses of readings are given, and essays on leading
characters and topics. We have talks on subjects of general
interest and Round-Table conversations. On memorial
days we have readings from the authors whose day we celebrate.
We allow considerable time for music, for the
singing of class songs, and we expect all qualified to furnish
music, to do so by making their own selections. Once a
year we give an entertainment of a musical and literary
character, inviting friends who are not members. From
time to time we have public lectures, arranged on subjects
of interest and connected with C. L. S. C. work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Rev. R. H. Howard writes from Saxonville, Massachusetts:
Under what was at first deemed extremely unpropitious
circumstances we have now what appears to be a
flourishing circle in this place. At the outset all signs
seemed discouraging; but the energy and pluck of a few
young ladies were honored by the awakening of marked
and very hopeful interest in the enterprise, and our meetings
thus far have been fully attended and enthusiastic.
Even the perplexing, though unavoidable, delay in obtaining
the text-books has not perceptibly dampened or diminished
the ardor excited. Meanwhile, not feeling able to
purchase large and expensive maps and charts, one of our
members, who wields a facile pencil, sketches, on a large
scale, such maps and charts as we require as we proceed. A
large map, in connection with a history exercise in a circle
meeting, would seem to be indispensable. Certain charts,
also, however simple or crude, illustrative of geological
formations, and race and language relations, cannot but
serve a very important purpose. Let me observe just here,
that I learn that the same enthusiasm in C. L. S. C. work
that has been developed in this place is obtaining in adjoining
communities. Teachers in public schools, I am told,
gather, after the labors of the day, in one of the school-rooms,
and, for an hour or so, daily, read together. How
interesting a spectacle! Yea, in view of this interest in
these higher intellectual pursuits, thus awakened among
these young people under my own eye, I have been impressed,
as never before, as I have thought of the vast popular
intellectual ferment produced throughout the country,
not to say throughout the world, by this wonderful C. L. S.
C. of Dr. Vincent’s. Arising from this very wide-spread,
and ever-extending and deepening interest in, and devotion
to intellectual and moral pursuits, crowned through his
timely instrumentality, what could well have been more
timely, aye, providential, in the best sense of the term, than
this movement? Who can begin to estimate its results in
the years and ages to come? Already the important fact is
developed that the life, and doubtless the continued existence,
of Chautauqua, Framingham Assembly, and other
similar enterprises, are bound up in, and are destined to depend
upon the support derived from the C. L. S. C. The
mother thus already leans hard upon the young and vigorous
daughter.</p>

<p>At Elkham, Wisconsin, local circle, the president appoints
two or more members at each meeting to prepare
questions on the lesson for the next week. These members
teach that part of the lesson on which they have prepared
questions. Some recite with open books, while others are
prepared to answer the questions with closed books. The
questions and answers published in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>
are always used as a review. Of course there is a free interchange
of opinion and frequent discussions on points of the
lesson, which are of peculiar interest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Meriden, Connecticut.</i>—The officers of our local circle constitute
the Instruction Committee. The president appoints
a committee of five, whose duty it is to assist the Instruction
Committee. Said committee appoint leaders of reviews, and,
in fact, they have charge of all work of the circle, memorial
exercises, lectures, entertainments, etc. We have another
committee of four, whose work it is to see all strangers at meetings
of the circle, and invite them to join; also to welcome
new members, and see that they are introduced to other members,
especially to the officers and Instruction Committee.
We number seventy members, thirty-four regular and thirty-six
local members. We regret to say that we lost one member
by death, last summer; quite a young man, and, so far
as we know, the only one who has taken the White Seal
course. We regret his death, as he promised to become a
valuable member to our circle. A few have left the circle
this year, but new members are continually being added,
eight names being proposed at our last meeting. We meet
the first and third Monday evenings of each month. Some
of our members walk from a mile to a mile and a half to attend
the meetings. Our method of work is as follows: We
open the meeting with singing and prayer; all business is
then transacted. We have about five reviews in an evening.
At present the reviews are in Wilkinson’s Preparatory
Greek Course, History of Russia, and English and
Scandinavian History and Literature. These are prepared
in the following manner: One member prepares from three
to twelve questions on a subject, gives them to other members
to answer at next meeting, and at that time calls for
answers, and gives other members opportunity to ask any
questions on the subject. Five-minute essays are sometimes
read on other important subjects. We take up geology
soon, on which subject Prof. Chapin, Ph. D., president of
Meriden Scientific Circle, will give a few talks. The circle
has just decided to purchase the set of geological diagrams.
The committee intend all memorial days shall be celebrated
this year. Last June we had a circle picnic, spending the
day at a very pleasant place about twelve miles from here.
It was a great success. Monday evening, September 18, we
had memorial exercises for Garfield Day. On Monday evening,
October 2, Rev. J. L. Hurlbut, of Plainfield, delivered
a public lecture under the auspices of the circle, his
subject being, “How to Spend our Leisure.” Both the lecturer
and lecture have been very highly spoken of by all
who attended, and we consider it the greatest success of all
lectures as yet given. Our circle is growing, and we believe
a great amount of good has been and is being done by it.</p>

<p>The local circles of the C. L. S. C. of Cincinnati, O., have
this winter adopted the plan of visiting each other. This
new arrangement was commenced on Tuesday evening, Oct.
31,—the Wesley, York street and Grace Church circles visiting
the one at Christie Chapel. The lesson for the evening
was a review of Grecian History, and was ably conducted by
Mr. John A. Johnson, President of the Christie Circle. At
the close of the lesson some minutes were passed in social
intercourse, and then followed a comparison of the methods
pursued in conducting the various circles present. All expressed
themselves highly pleased with the meeting and it
is the purpose to continue them throughout the year, as this
system of visitation serves to make the members better acquainted
with each other, which is desirable in a large city
like Cincinnati. It also serves to strengthen the bond of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
fellowship existing among those engaged in the common
cause.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first of the 3rd series of free lectures, under the auspices
of the Chautauqua Circles of Cincinnati and vicinity,
was given at Christie Chapel M. E. Church, corner of Court
and Wesley avenue, in October. The church was filled with
a highly intelligent and attentive audience. Rev. Dr.
Blackburn, of Central Presbyterian Church, delivered a
very instructive and eloquent lecture of an hour’s length on
the subject, “The Origin and Spirit of the Greeks.” The
lecturer traced the march of the Greeks from their Aryan
fatherland, ranged them in the two main divisions of the
Ionians and the Dorians; traced the rise of Doric Sparta and
Ionic Athens; sketched their periods of successive overlordship;
showed the want of political unity in all the Greek
States, and emphasized the fact of a social unity in the Pan-Hellenic
sentiment, the Greek language, religion, Amphictyonic
council, festivals, literature, philosophy and art.
The Greeks could appreciate a good thing wherever it originated.
They caused art to stand out in its own beauty and
on its own merits. The lecture closed with these words:
“Greece had a mission to the human race, a noble work for
the world. It was not in the domain of political government,
nor of conscience, but in that of intellect. The lasting
outcome of her work was culture. She fulfilled her mission.
She ran her race among the nations and won the laurel.
She fell, and thorns now bind her delicate hands, but
the old olive wreath has not faded. The heritage of her culture
has passed to the westward Aryans. We read our New
Testament and remember her marvelous gift of speech. We
run our Christian course and think of the Olympian races.
Plato is studied where Paul is believed. The classics are recited
where the Gospel is read for its wonderful words of life.”</p>

<p><i>Flushing, Michigan.</i>—Our local circle meets every Friday
evening. We have roll-call, and each member responds,
either with a verse of Scripture or a gem from one of the
poets, as decided on at our last meeting. Then singing and
prayer. We next take the questions given in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>,
with additional questions on some of the required
reading. We also have select reading or an essay
each week. We had ten members last year; we now have
eighteen. Our first meeting for this year was on the evening
of September 29. The exercises were as follows: Reading
of Psalms i:8-23; President’s greeting; essay on “The
Excellencies of the C. L. S. C.;” recitation, “Hope Song of
C. L. S. C.;” Bryant’s letter on the C. L. S. C.; paper on
the “Design and Method in the C. L. S. C.” Then followed
the enrollment of members by the secretary, and the appointment
of committees by the president.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Nebraska City, Nebraska.</i>—Two years ago our C. L. S. C.
sprang into existence in the form of a triangle, widened
into a circle in 1881, and now, in 1882, we have a membership
of thirty. Monthly meetings have been held, at
which we have had short oral accounts of subjects discussed
in Geology, and questions and answers on Greek
history. A noticeable feature of our last meeting was a
“match” on the pronunciation of words selected from our
reading. Were Herodotus or Thucydides present at our
meetings, we think he would take pity upon us, and give
to his places and men names less jaw-breaking to learn.
The correct pronunciation of them seems to us like a “piling
of Pelion upon Ossa.” Though our officers are ladies,
we have able gentlemen in our circle. Some of the reading
is a little “deep” for us, but, by perseverance, we hope
to come up to it, “since the mountain can not come to
Mahomet.” We all now see its beneficence insomuch that
we present a unanimous vote of thanks to the projector of
this grand scheme—the People’s College.</p>

<h3><a id="ANSWERS_TO_QUESTIONS_FOR_FURTHER_STUDY_IN_THE_NOVEMBER_NUMBER_OF_THE_CHAUTAUQUAN"></a>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY IN THE NOVEMBER
NUMBER OF THE CHAUTAUQUAN.</h3>


<h4><i>Geology.</i></h4>

<p>1. The glacial streams from ice-caves that are the sources
of the Arveiron and the Rhone rivers are milk-white from
the presence of innumerable molecules of triturated rock
which they bear suspended. This powdered rock is in the
form of a very fine, impalpable mud. It is an unctious,
sticky deposit, and only requires pressure to knead it into
a tenacious clay. This mud owes its origin to the grinding
power of the glacier, the stones and sand being crushed and
pulverized upon the rock below.</p>

<p>2. The Grinnell glacier, discovered by Captain Hall, is
just north of and adjacent to Hudson’s Strait, on the extreme
southern point of Baffin’s Land, called Meta Incognita.</p>

<p>3. The Loffoden Islands are famous for the great maelstrom,
which is a narrow passage between two of them.
They are also noted for their fisheries. The evidences of the
powerful wearing action of tidal currents is seen in their extremely
rugged and precipitous coasts, and deep channels.
Sharp pointed peaks three to four thousand feet above the
sea, rise nearly perpendicularly out of the water.</p>

<p>4. The volcano of Jorullo is situated one hundred and sixty
miles southeast of the City of Mexico. It is famous for its
recent and sudden upheaval during a single night, in the
midst of a fertile and highly cultivated plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Earthquakes are spoken of as “convulsive movements
of Old Vulcan” for the reason that the ancients ascribed the
cause of them to that God. Vulcan was the god of fire, and
his workshop was generally supposed to be in some volcanic
island.</p>

<p>6. The connection of the former island of Tyre with the
continent is not wholly due to the rising of the land from
beneath. In the siege of Tyre by Alexander, 332 B. C., he
united the island to the main land by an enormous artificial
mole. This has been increased by ruins and alluvial deposits.</p>


<h4><i>History of Greece.</i></h4>

<p>1. Earth and water given to the Persian heralds were regarded
as symbols of submission, because the earth represented
the land, and the water the sea, and the meaning was
that they were willing to yield dominion of both to the Persians.</p>

<p>2. The festival of the Karneian Apollo was a festival observed
in many of the Grecian cities, especially in Sparta,
where it was first instituted, in honor of Apollo Carneius.
The celebration lasted nine days, and during the time nine
tents were pitched near the city, and nine men lived in them
after the manner of a military camp, obeying in everything
the order of a herald.</p>

<p>3. The pæan, or war song of the Greeks, was a song originally
sung in honor of Apollo, and was always of a joyous
nature. It was also sung as a battle song, both before an attack
on an enemy, and after the battle was finished. In
later times it was sometimes sung in honor of mortals.</p>

<p>4. The tomb of Mausolus is one of the seven wonders of
the world, associated with the name of Artemisia, queen of
Halicarnassus, inasmuch as the Mausoleum was built by
another queen of the same name, distinguished as Artemicia,
queen of Caria.</p>

<p>5. According to Thucydides the sacrifice made by Pausanias
during the battle of Platæa was made to Jupiter in the
market-place of Platæa. It was a bloody sacrifice, probably
of some domestic animal, and from the entrails or the manner
of the death the soothsayers sought to interpret the will
of the gods.</p>

<p>6. The Island of Delos was called sacred because it was
said to have been the birth-place of Apollo and Diana. In
426 B. C. it was purified by the Athenians by having all
tombs removed from it.</p>


<h4><i>Geology.</i></h4>

<p>1. The Fille-Fond, or Fille-Field, is a mountain plateau
of Norway, connected with the Songe-Fjeld on the north
and the Hardanger-Fjeld on the south. The summits vary
in height from 4,900 feet to 6,300 feet.</p>

<p>2. The common name of the Chimæra is the Sea-cat. It
is so called on account of its eyes. They have a greenish
pupil surrounded by a white iris, and they shine, especially
at night, like cats’ eyes. It is also called “King of the Herring.”</p>

<p>3. By the “Old Red Sandstone” of Europe is meant the
Devonian Rocks. These rocks are called “red” on account
of their color, and “old” to distinguish them from the New
Red Sandstone, which appears in the triassic period.</p>

<p>4. Some of the eccentric features which probably caused
the astonishment of Cuvier on examining the Plesiosauri for
the first time are the following: to a lizard’s head it united
the teeth of a crocodile, a neck like a serpent’s body, the trunk
and tail of a quadruped, the vertebræ of a fish, the ribs of a
chameleon, and the fins of a whale.</p>

<p>5. Some of the fossil footprints in the Connecticut Valley,
made by colossal reptiles, are called “bird tracks” because
they were at first supposed to be the tracks of birds, a large
part of them resembling the impressions of birds’ feet more
than those of any known animal.</p>

<p>6. The Loup Fork Beds are beds of Pliocene deposit which
occur on the Loup Fork of the Platte River in the Upper
Missouri region.</p>


<h4><i>History of Greece.</i></h4>

<p>1. The Helots were Spartan slaves. They were said to
have been the native population of a portion of the Peloponnesus,
and to have been subjected to slavery by the invading
Dorians.</p>

<p>2. The “sacred wars” were wars relative to the possession
of the Temple at Delphi and its treasures.</p>

<p>3. The Alkmæonidæ were a noble and wealthy family of
Athens, descended from Alkmæon, who was a descendant of
King Codrus. They were considered sacrilegious on account
of the way in which Megacles, one of the family,
treated the insurgents under Cylon. Having taken refuge
at the altar of Minerva, on the Acropolis, Megacles induced
them to withdraw on the promise that their lives should be
spared, but their enemies put them to death as soon as they
had them in their power.</p>

<p>4. The Untori, in the plague of Milan, in 1630, were persons
suspected of anointing doors with pestilential ointment,
and thus spreading the disease. Many persons were
arrested and put to death on this suspicion.</p>

<p>5. Hermes was the Greek name for Mercury, the messenger
of the gods.</p>

<p>6. The class Mothakes were emancipated Helots, who
had been domestic slaves.</p>

<p>The lecturer of the afternoon, Colonel Daniels, of Virginia,
was introduced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel Daniels</span>: Your commander-in-chief and shepherd
of this flock asked me to talk about “How to Teach
Geology.” I did not come down here for any such purpose.
I came to have a little rest and have a good time, and get
acquainted with Chautauqua. But as I am here, I am
glad to be set at work in any way to keep me out of mischief.</p>

<p>He said on a subsequent occasion that he did not want
me to give a written lecture. That reminds me of a story
that I heard Senator Nye tell years ago in a speech. He
told of one of those excellent boys that die young, standing
by the roadside, and a man was on a prancing steed. The
man said, “Boy, when I get up to you, don’t you take off
your hat and make a bow and scare this colt; he will throw
me off.” Said the boy, with rustic simplicity, “I was not
going to.” [Applause and laughter.]</p>

<p>I suppose that my excellent friend has to keep on guard.
There are prowling around through these trees people with
their pockets stuffed full of old sermons and lectures, and
he is always on guard to keep them from firing them off to
scare his pet C. L. S. C. So I was not mad a bit. [Laughter.]</p>

<p>Well, now, to plunge <i>in medias res</i>, it is a beautiful
thing to study geology. This planet was our birth place.
It is the way of God. And here in its strata is written by
the finger of God himself the history of all that mighty
series of events through which it passed from the time it
emerged from primary chaos until to-day. It is scarcely
possible that any person should believe in studying the
works of God, and fail to see that this portion of his work,
which lies in immediate contact with us, from which in so
many ways we draw sustenance, in connection with which
we have our being, and from out of which flows the stream
of that abundant supply which God has provided for his
children, and which for all our time is to be the theater of
action of our race, should be studied.</p>

<p>But how, how taught? Don’t give any written lectures
now. I will tell you how not to do it. If you are going to
teach geology, don’t deliver written lectures. Write all
you can about it, but don’t deliver it. I delivered a written
lecture once, and that is the reason I never delivered any
more.</p>

<p>I began studying geology when a boy, when I was put to
studying a hoe-handle and ten acres of corn for about three
weeks. There were lots of these pieces of stone, and my
uncle, a good old Methodist class-leader, told me that God
put those stones there at the time of the deluge. That satisfied
me. But when I was on a government survey away in
the West, I saw hundreds and thousands of feet of those
rocks, such as I saw this morning when I picked up these
stones. Here you see a complete mass of shells. Such
rocks make up the bluffs of the Mississippi River. We
have twenty thousand feet of these in Colorado. Major Buell
told me that he got in one place twenty-seven thousand
feet. Then I was not satisfied. I began to look a little further.
By-and-by, in the district school library, I got hold
of Randall’s Geology, that blessed old book, and it began to
open my mind a little. I was on these surveys, and I began
to have more and more practical lessons. Among the lead
mines of Wisconsin I found the miners wanted practical
knowledge, and I undertook to teach them a little. I remember
my first attempt on a slate; then I took my bristol-board
and made some diagrams. And then in a store,
and then in a church; in the basement first, and then I got
up into the church. So I taught the rudest kind of people,
and from one lecture, I gave two, three, four, five, and
on up to fifteen. I gained a local reputation, and got to be
State Geologist of Wisconsin, and was tolerably well known
in that country as a practical geologist. But I had no scientific
knowledge of geology.</p>

<p>A good friend of mine wanted to see me advanced in life,
and so sent word to me if I would come and deliver a lecture
on geology before the board of their college, he thought I
would get a professorship. It was an Old School Presbyterian
college. I prepared myself without regard to expense.
I went down to Boston, and saw Prof. Hitchcock and Prof.
Agassiz, and I hunted through the books, and I made a
lecture. You ought to have heard it. [Laughter.] You
would not be here now. [Laughter.] It treated of all the
cosmogonies; it went through primal chaos, through the
azoic, the silurian, the devonian, and the various strata,
until it introduced man on the scene. It took me two hours.
It was a cold night, and they all shivered, and looked as if
they wished I was in some warmer place. I did not get the
professorship, and the college died the next year. [Laughter.]</p>

<p>Write all you can, it tends to make you accurate and fixes
your knowledge, and then do with it as a good old Methodist
presiding elder told me once on a time. We had planted
some melons and cucumbers, but he did not seem to be
pleased with them. He told the folks that we had splendid
cucumbers, and he knew how to fix them: slice them up
thin, put them in water, turn off the water, and put on pepper
and salt, and throw them out of the window. That is
what you are to do with the written lectures, read, write,
and, as Emerson says, get drunk with your subject. You
will not hear anything more of the dryness of your subject.
It makes a subject dry because a man has not got
enough of it in him to see the great connecting principles in
him, so that he is aroused and sees the ultimate of it as
well as the details, and the ultimate of it is man. It is for
man and made for man. This being created here and being
put in the midst of all of these things, is to make him greater,
grander, and bring him into relation with the truth, and
then by symmetrizing his being and aligning him with God
in the great work of God, that is to make of this globe a
heaven.</p>

<p>Geology will help you to do that, as the Bishop said yesterday,
it will give you visions of the infinite possibilities of
yourselves when you once align yourselves with God and
live up to the truth. God has put into your hands the power
to subordinate this globe, its storms, its climates, and their
condition; you want geology for that. You want to begin to
know these rocks at Chautauqua. I would like to put in
your collection first, all the stones in the vicinity of Chautauqua.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Go out into the quarry, with its masonry that God
has built. Here you find the stones all covered over with
God’s hieroglyphics, here they are, corals, shells, and things
that were alive. If you knew a way of petrifying these trees
and plants, would you not think it was a pleasing way and
do it? Here it is done. Here you have a study, a whole
natural history, a whole natural creation that God made in
order to make man possible, and capable of producing grain
and grass and flower to make man live, all depending upon
the fact that these rocks were built up as you find them to-day.</p>

<p>You find the old rocks arranged in strata, layers. You
have them there by the depot. How was that? Go by the
hillside. Let a portion of the drops of rain get together and
make a stream, and they will form a gulley. What do you
see? The soil has been washed out, and the material of the
soil has been spread out. A pond, perhaps, will be there,
such as you and I used to navigate, and then it dries up on
the surface, and cracks at right angles. Here it is. There
was a little mud puddle, and it cracked when it dried up.
If you will take up a piece of it, you will find that it is arranged
in layers. Here, see that. Through all that summer,
and the previous summer, there was a succession of
storms, and each one brought its contribution to the whole.
If it was a big storm, it was thick, if a little storm, it was
thin. Just like the exogenous trees. You count the lines
of growth, and know the age of the tree. We have one
layer spread over the other, all little volumes, but when it
has quit growing, as in libraries, you will have a thick
book. So, I say the layers write the storms of the past.</p>

<p>What else would we find there? If there were snails,
leaves and sticks, they would be carried down and buried in
the mud. If we take a section, and take out all that loose
stuff, we have a section which gives a history of the different
seasons, and the animals and plants that washed in
there during the time that little mud puddle had been in
existence. That is the beginning, the starting point of all
the knowledge of the rocks; to begin right by us and see
what is done now, and observe that wearing action. If you
will go from that little gulley on the hillside to a larger valley,
and still larger, to the great valley of the Mississippi,
you will find the same thing repeated.</p>

<p>Here is a specimen that I got right here where they are
ballasting the road. Here you could see a mass of sand and
gravel. It goes on wherever there is sand and gravel and
there is lime and water; it is compounded together. We
have there fossils. Here, for instance, you have various
forms of plants and corals, and so on, and you have here in
the rocks right about you shells, coral, seaweed, preserved in
the same way. Thus you get your petrefactions. Thus you
get the layers that you call strata. All these layers of rock
are simply sediment that was once carried down and spread
out in a body of water. Is not that simple enough?</p>

<p>Here is that slab, all covered over with seaweed and
shells, that was one time a bottom of the ocean; there was
a volume of clay, and you see resting in there rolls of seaweed.
Trailing over this all along these shores on the spot
where we now stand, there were seaweed, and coral, and all
the animal life. Here is a head of a large animal, a cephalopod,
and here is a tail, and the rest of the body is probably
under the railroad track. Here is a curved shell. This
rock abounds in the ocean. They were the pirates of the
ocean. They were the ancient devilfish. They had enormous
arms. They were very fine in their time, but, as
some one says about the Pilgrim Fathers, we should be
thankful that they did not come down to us.</p>

<p>We have another class of rocks in our boulders and hard
heads. Here are some without any section. Here is a
mass of modern lava. Here you see this huge mass. All
these landscapes show the different kinds of rocks in their
relations. This irregular mass is the unstratified rocks.
They have been melted and cooled from a state of melting.
We know them to be crystals. They consist of quartz,
feldspar, and mica, which are the alphabet of mineralogy.
We have the crystals, which we know only exist when
there has been a state of melting. These unstratified rocks
are the material of all our quarries and great rocks.</p>

<p>There are two great classes: the stratified, in layers,
which came from sediment deposited in the ancient seas,
and the unstratified, which were once melted masses
thrown out of the interior of the earth. The granite, the
unstratified rocks, form the backbone of the continent;
they are the underlying rocks. They occur as veins, coming
up through the stratified rocks, and overflowing the
surface.</p>

<p>Now, in this section of the rocks which we have as they
are stratified, formed in layers one above the other, we
come to the idea of time. I was going along this morning,
with a basket and one of these stones in my hand, and a
man’s attention was attracted, and he asked how long since
those animals were alive. I said a million of years. He
looked rather astonished, and expressed himself that I
could not know. The idea of such great amounts of time
strikes any one like the vast areas of space. At the first
step in geology we have got to expand our notions of time.
The six thousand years will not do. Some people think
there is something in the Bible about six thousand years.
There is no such thing. It is a chronology that has grown
up like Milton’s Paradise Lost. Many people think that
Milton’s Paradise Lost is a part of the Bible. In Genesis
we are told of days, which everybody understands to mean
periods of time, and of time since the beginning, when the
earth was without form and void. We have nothing definite
said in the Bible, or any other book, except the approximate
indications which are found in the great stone book
of Nature.</p>

<p>Let us look at the idea of time, and see how we get at it. If
we should come again to the mud puddle dried up, we should
get an approximate idea of how long it took to form the deposit.
Suppose we do not know the history, we know about
the number of storms that are usual, and the amount of rainfall,
and we have some guide in that succession of layers
that are there. In the ancient rocks we have exactly the
same guide. Somebody says in answer to all this, that in
some places deposits take place very rapidly, and we can
not judge. For instance, a flood in the Mississippi bears down
a vast amount of matter. There is a delta of the Mississippi
that has been built out during the memory of man. Whenever
we find coarse material in a delta we say it was rapidly
formed; if it is fine material, we say it was formed
slowly. To-day the Mississippi is bearing down a vast mass
of material, and the coarser materials drop by the mouth,
but the finer are carried out over the sea, perhaps along the
shore. This fine silt settles down amid the corals, the
sea-weed and the ships. If the ocean could be drained, we
would find on the decks of the ships that have been sunk a
hundred years, as the divers tell us, this deposition on the
bottom of the sea. No one can doubt about these deposits
which have so many shells, that the deposit was made very
slowly, because it would have been impossible for the shells
to have lived if the material had been thrown down rapidly.</p>

<p>Therefore, when we come to take the rate of deposit, and
the vast thickness of these rocks into account, we have a
basis for determining approximately the periods of the
time during which these rocks have formed. Of course, it
is only to those who become minutely intelligent in regard
to the details that this thought will have weight. If, for
instance, I should go along where a man was cutting a tree,
and count the annular rings, and I had never seen a tree
cut down; if he should say an hundred years ago that tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
was an acorn, I should be astonished, and it would have no
weight with me, for I would not have the knowledge necessary.
It is necessary to become familiar with this class
of phenomena. Therefore in the beginning we want to
study the phenomena that are taking place on the seashore,
at the mouth of the rivers, and compare these with the
phenomena that we find in the rock.</p>

<p>I recall a notable instance of this: That grand man, President
Hitchcock, long since gone to rest, one of the greatest
and most eminent scientists of his State, discovered
tracks in the valley of the Connecticut River. He had to
classify some sixty different classes of tracks, which are
found in the valley of the Connecticut sandstone ledges,
which, when it was soft, was admirably calculated to receive
impressions. His attention was called to them, and
he made them out to be bird tracks. The European naturalists
were very reluctant to believe it. They did not believe
that any such discovery could be made by any American.
They sent over a man to see the alleged bird tracks,
and he went all over the museum, and he went down to
the quarry and saw all the specimens, and went away and
came back again. President Hitchcock asked him about
it, and he said that he did not think there were any bird
tracks there. After dinner he took him out to the porch.
A few days before he had found a flat stone, on which mud
had been deposited, and a snipe had walked over it; the mud
dried, and he thought it was an exact parallel with his
bird tracks. So he put it on his porch. The gentleman
said, “What have you got here?” There they were, the
tracks of a bird, and a wader. He said nothing. He went
away, and said they were bird tracks. He wrote afterward
that he had for the first time to study how a wading bird
walked on both sides of a median line. And so when he
studied the habits of a bird, he saw that these fossils were
bird tracks. I speak of this because it is a key.</p>

<p>I allude again to that sermon of Bishop Simpson’s, where
Job asks these questions, and the Lord tells him to find out
that right next to him. Why don’t you study that, and interpret
it in that manner so sensible? You find everywhere we
are doing that. On that account people can not get a knowledge
of geology, because geology asks you to commence
right at the door. Stoop and pick up the pebble there;
learn the soil, and teach yourselves and your children what
it was. This is a progressive world where we have all got
to begin. It seems wonderful that we have not done that
before. If you will try it, if you will get the first weed by
your door, and teach your children about it, and go out further
and study geology and all the other ologies in that
way, life will be lifted on the highest plane for all. [Applause.]
Everybody that has tried that has found an exceeding
great reward.</p>

<p>[Applause.]</p>

<p>Now, I simply say, if there are those who wish to pursue
the study of geology, I will be very glad while I stay here
to be of any assistance I can to you. I know the difficulty
of starting without some help. The geology published here
by Prof. Packard is an admirable little treatise, but with the
reading of that you need observation and the knowledge to
be gained by handling the specimens. If there are those
who would like to learn, I am at liberty after 5 o’clock in
the morning for a few days. I get up at 5 and keep very
still. If you could keep those bells still that keep me awake
until about 11:30: I like babies, but if you could put the
babies in some babies’ retreat for a little while——.</p>

<p>The geological charts are excellent for teaching in a circle
or a school. These are the charts that are published with
Prof. Packard’s Geology. With the book they will enable
one to get a very good idea of geology. If you will take up
geology now, and start here, we will start from the quarry.
These specimens will decay; one-half of them will go down
into the lake very soon. I went out here and saw these
splendid books being wasted, so I made use of a few of them.
These will be a starting point in your museum, and then
every C. L. S. C. on this continent will send from his
locality a box of specimens, two or three of them, express
paid, to your museum, and I will send my quota from West
Virginia. And I will come over here some time and help
label them. [Applause.]</p>

<p>[Pointing to the charts behind him.] Here is a section of
rocks from below, and here are the different phenomena of
volcanic action. Here is a picture of the ancient seas. There
is one of these valleys. There are vast species of chambered
shells. We have now only one species living, the
chambered nautilus. The animal had the power of increasing
or diminishing his density by absorbing or casting out
water. Here is another representative of the animals that
have been restored by the laws of comparative anatomy.
Cuvier, or Agassiz, by a bone, or scale, even, could restore
an animal. Here are some of your ancestors. Here is a
specimen of the plesiosaurus and the iguanodon. These are
marine animals. These are more modern. This is the
period of bone caves. This was a great clawed animal, that
was for a long time supposed to be a lion. Here is a representation
of the ice period, of which you hear so much, the
period when the huge boulders were brought down. The
entire collection will be one of value.</p>

<p>I thank you for your attention. [Applause.]</p>

<p>After some conversation on preparation for Commencement
day, the Round-Table adjourned.</p>

<h2><a name="EDITORS_OUTLOOK" id="EDITORS_OUTLOOK">EDITOR’S OUTLOOK.</a></h2>


<h3>Our National Education.</h3>

<p>From the time that Washington boasted of a system that
proposes to furnish the means of education to “every child of
the republic,” the educational spirit has been a prominent
characteristic of our people. Amid all our national vicissitudes
and struggles, defending the flag from foes without
and within, cutting down the forests to make farms for cultivation,
and clearing up the waste places to make them
habitable, we have never lost our educational enterprise.
In the far West, as well as in Maine and Massachusetts, you
meet it. Not to be wondered at, either, is this in a people
who had the courage and faith to launch such a governmental
scheme as is ours. Indeed, it required little discernment to
see that popular institutions could be served by no other
handmaid than popular education.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to note that our zeal for education did not
prove a transient impulse, but that of an abiding conviction.
Never have the reports from all parts of the Union, taken as
a whole, been so encouraging as now. Stupidity and demagogism
are still to be found in many places, and, of course,
as ever, doing their best to hinder progress. But in spite of
all such influences, educators throughout the nation feel
that the cause, with the modifications of better methods, is
understood and appreciated by the better and larger part of
the public. An examination of reports and statistics of all
the States and Territories for ten years past, shows advancement
in almost every instance. Financial depression or
shifting population will explain the exceptions. In the
State of Ohio in the single year of 1879-80, three-fourths
of a million dollars was expended in new school-houses.
The young State of West Virginia reports seventeen hundred
more teachers employed at the close of the decade than
at the beginning. The State of Missouri reports a like number,
and an increased enrollment of nearly sixty thousand,
exclusive of those who had come of school age, thus showing
a deep inroad into the ranks of illiteracy. These citations
illustrate the advance movement all along the line.
And while our common schools are thus moving onward, it
is no less a sign of national devotion to education that
schools of higher grades are springing up everywhere.
Special and charitable schools for the deaf and dumb, for the
weak-minded, industrial training schools, etc., all of them
upheld by the same national spirit. Nor to be forgotten are
the schools for all classes at home, where by correspondence
and concert of work, results which none can measure are attained.
Let us rejoice and give thanks!</p>

<p>But the most hopeful thought that comes to us in connection
with our national education, is of the fact that in
nearly all parts of the country it is required that moral instruction
be given in the schools. “Instruction in morals
and good manners,” is the language of requirement in the
school laws of many States. Others charge “all instructors
to impress on the youth committed to them the principles
of morality, justice, a sacred regard of truth, love of country,
chastity, temperance, etc.” The school code of New
Hampshire demands that “religion, piety, and morality
be encouraged.” In several States the Bible is to be
brought before the pupils by the prescribed daily reading
of it, as in Massachusetts and the District of Columbia; and
in many others the reading of it has express legalization.
Herein is the sheet anchor of all our hopes. Cultured mind
and heart alone give assurance of a successful national voyage.</p>

<h3>Professor Henry Draper.</h3>

<p>The scientific world has suffered a heavy loss in the death
of Professor Henry Draper, of New York. He was the son
of Dr. John W. Draper, one of the most eminent scientific
men this country has produced. Professor Draper inherited
the tastes and talents of his illustrious father, and, while
yet a youth, began his scientific and physiological investigations.
He received his early educational training in the
public schools of New York, after which he spent two years
in the Academic Department of the University of the City
of New York. During all this time his studies were under
the careful supervision of his father, who was a professor in
the University. After completing his sophomore year he
entered upon the study of medicine, and received his degree
in 1858. After his graduation he spent a year in Europe in
study and travel, and on his return to this country he received
an appointment on the medical staff of Bellevue
Hospital. He continued in this position for two years,
when he was elected to the chair of physiology in the City
University. When he entered upon his duties as professor
he discontinued the practice of medicine, which he never
afterward resumed, and gave himself wholly to teaching
and to original investigation in natural science, but was
especially devoted to the study of chemistry and astronomy.
He was not, however, dependent upon the facilities afforded
by the University to enable him to pursue his investigations
in his favorite sciences, but, being possessed of ample
means, he had a finely equipped laboratory fitted up in his
own apartments, and also erected an observatory for his
own use.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate his astronomical observations, Professor
Draper constructed an equatorial telescope, with an
aperture of twenty-eight inches, for his private observatory
at Hastings, on the Hudson. This telescope was the work
of his own hands, and when completed was the largest one
of the kind in the United States. His astronomical investigations
were principally of a photographical character. He
was peculiarly adapted to this kind of work, since he had
studied photography with his father, who was a pioneer in
the photographic art, having taken the first photographic
likeness of the human face ever obtained. By means of his
large telescope, Professor Draper was able to take the largest
and finest photographs of the heavenly bodies ever obtained,
and by this means greatly advanced the interests of science.
To him was due also the discovery of the gelatino-bromide
dry process of photography, which has proven so useful to
the art of photography, especially in its application to
astronomy. In 1874, after much labor and many costly experiments,
he succeeded in obtaining photographs of the
fixed lines of stellar spectra, which no one before had ever
been able to accomplish. By obtaining photographs of the
spectrum of the sun he was able to demonstrate the existence
of oxygen in that luminary, a fact never before known
to astronomers. His numerous and successful efforts in
this line of work rendered him so conspicuous that he was
conceded to be without a peer in the department of sidereal
photography. As a result of his grand achievements the
commissioners appointed by Congress to make arrangements
for the observation of the transit of Venus, in 1874, selected
him as the superintendent of the photographic department.
He performed his duties with such efficiency that Congress
ordered a gold medal to be presented to him, bearing the
inscription: “He adds lustre to ancestral glory.”</p>

<p>In addition to being an expert in astronomical photography
Professor Draper was a fine analytical chemist, and in
addition to his work as professor of physiology, for several
years he taught analytical chemistry in the University.
During the last few years of his life he was very much interested
in the subject of electricity, and gave much time
and study to the problem of overcoming the difficulties of
adapting the electric light to practical use, and contributed
much valuable information on this point.</p>

<p>Although so enthusiastically devoted to the interests of
science, Professor Draper was not a recluse, but was of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
fine social turn. He was a fluent talker, an entertaining
companion and a genial host. When the first symptoms of
his fatal illness came upon him he was engaged in entertaining
at dinner, in his hospitable home on Madison avenue,
New York, the members of the National Academy of
Science. He died in the prime of his years and in the fulness
of his mental strength. The country can ill-afford to
lose men of such mental ability and so enthusiastically devoted
to scientific research.</p>

<h3>Co-Education.</h3>

<p>Rising in interest and importance above every other
phase of the “woman question,” is that of her education, her
higher education, and from this the question of co-education.
The first cause which has associated the idea of co-education
with the higher education of women, has been
the fact that higher educational facilities are, with very
few exceptions, limited to the colleges and universities established
for the education of men. If woman is to receive
higher education it is apparent at the start that the institutions
called woman’s colleges and seminaries are inadequate
to the work. Hence, whatever other considerations
may enter into the co-education problem, this much is
clear: if women now, or at any time in the near future, are
to have these facilities they must come by some system of
co-education, as only institutions now existing for men can
furnish them. This suggests the economic and time element
of the question. Colleges and universities of ability to do
the work of higher education are not born in a day. The
best representatives of such institutions in this country and
in England are the growth of centuries, and their cabinets,
laboratories, museums, libraries, and endowments the results
of weary, slow accumulations.</p>

<p>Not to speak now of the other and more positive reasons
in its favor, reasons growing out of the association of the
sexes in recitation and lecture-room, and the wholesome
influences on each thus secured, let us see what are the objections
urged by its opponents. We hear a good deal
about the tendency to make coarse the naturally fine fibre
of woman, about constitutional differences of intellect, and
difference of sphere and pursuits in life. Now, in all soberness,
if there is anything in this idea that association of the
sexes tends to rob woman of the charms of fineness and
gentleness peculiar to her, how is it that she has managed
to keep them from the days of Adam and Eve until now?
And as to differences of intellect, they are neither so constitutional
nor “unconstitutional” as to disqualify her for
an even race with her brother. If the testimony of professors
and college authorities, where the opportunity has
been given her, can be relied upon, whenever the race is
uneven it has been in her favor. The objection about
sphere and pursuits in life misconceives the true purpose of
education. The true conception is not addressed to pursuits,
but is of a solid foundation on which the special education
of pursuit or profession is erected.</p>

<p>Recognizing the force and truth of these and other considerations,
and acting up to their convictions, the great
and time-honored universities of the English speaking
world, Oxford and Cambridge, have led the way, and
thrown wide open their doors to young women seeking
their privileges. At these honored institutions young women
live in their own “halls,” as at some of our American
colleges, under care of women of highest social standing,
enter the same lecture-room and listen to the same lecture
with the young men. The following from a leading educational
journal, reveals the growing favor of co-education at
Cambridge: “Since the modest beginning thirteen years
ago of Girton College,—the woman’s college at Cambridge,—it
has twice been found necessary to make considerable
extensions. The students have proved themselves eager to
profit by the advantages afforded to them, as was shown by
their distinctions obtained at Cambridge this year. It is
now once more intended to develop the work of the college
by making further and more elaborate extensions. For
some time past a number of applicants have been refused
admission owing to the want of space, and plans have at
last been adopted which will make room for more students.”</p>

<p>It is not a little strange the illiberal spirit manifested by
some of the leading institutions of this country, instance the
narrow and partial conditions of the “Harvard Annex” and
the opposition by the trustees and part of the faculty of
Columbia College. In the latter case there is just now a
tidal wave of public sentiment in New York City sweeping
against the opposition, which, it is to be hoped, will overcome
all resistance. The leaven is working. It is a reform,
and reforms go forward in this nineteenth century. Geologists
tell us that six thousand years ago the age of man was
ushered in. Let the future geologists record this as the age
of man and woman, too.</p>

<h3>Thurlow Weed.</h3>

<p>Among noteworthy recent events is the death of Thurlow
Weed, the veteran journalist and politician. Mr. Weed had
nearly reached his eighty-fifth birthday with faculties well
preserved, and for more than half a century he was a very
prominent figure in our national political life. The son of
a poor cartman who never prospered, he had his own way
to make in the world, and from a striker in a blacksmith
shop, a cabin-boy upon river boats, and a chore-boy of a
printing office, he worked his way up to be the trusted adviser
of senators and presidents, and the man by whom officials,
high and low, were made and unmade. He was
twice a member of the State Assembly of New York,—in
1824 and 1829,—but never held any other office. He refused
official position for himself, but no man has been more influential
in securing it for others. Mr. Weed’s work as a
journalist was for the most part in connection with the Albany
<i>Evening Journal</i>, though before assuming control of
this paper he had edited a number of others, by one of which,
the <i>Anti-Masonic Enquirer</i>, he had gained wide celebrity.
During the thirty-two years of his management of the <i>Journal</i>
he made it with his trenchant pen one of the mightiest
of the auxiliaries of the Whig and Republican parties, and
he was himself a political leader second in influence to none.
Retiring from this paper in 1862, he afterward edited for a
time the New York <i>Commercial Advertiser</i>, but failing
health soon obliged him to drop finally the editorial pen.
He continued, however, to write for the press until a short
time before his death, and the occasional articles he sent to
different journals always commanded an eager reading. In
1866 letters which he wrote to the Albany <i>Evening Journal</i>
from Europe and the West Indies, when different visits
were made to these countries, were collected and published
in a handsome volume, without his consent.</p>

<p>There is much in the life-work of Mr. Weed for which he
should be gratefully remembered. Though he was a strong
and earnest partisan, he was a true patriot. He was a consistent
friend of human liberty and human equality. In the
early part of our civil war, in company with Bishop McIlvaine
and Archbishop Hughes, he went to Europe charged
with the important mission of promoting friendliness to the
Union cause on the other side of the water, and the mission
was discharged with great skill and faithfulness. Perhaps
to Mr. Weed for his work in connection with this embassy
the nation owes a greater debt than we know. To the close
of his life he was the earnest advocate of what we believe to
be a vicious principle in politics. He was not of those who
demand reform in the civil service. A change in the mode
by which the offices are filled in our land found no favor in
his eyes. The old way was good enough for him. He believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
with Andrew Jackson, that “to the victors belong the
spoils.” We can not greatly admire that <i>role</i> of party manager
which he played with such consummate ability. There
are higher ends certainly to which a man may give his
powers than the success of party and the elevation of men
to political stations. But this is to be said of Mr. Weed, he
was an upright and honorable man, and in playing the game
of politics he was actuated by better aims than those of
many. He left for his family quite a large estate, but it was
acquired through legitimate transactions of business. He
had a circle of friends of whom any one might be proud, and
they were by no means confined to the members of his own
political party. Probably by far the most valuable collection
of autograph letters in the land was in his possession.
His home-life was admirable. He had a benevolent spirit,
and his charitable gifts were many. And it is pleasant to
have it to record of him that he lived and died a believer in
evangelical religion. His interest in the Moody and Sankey
meetings in New York City a few years ago is well remembered.
We sum up his character: a man of strong will,
of indomitable perseverance and energy, of remarkable
power to control men and attach men to himself, and pure
and good in private life.</p>

<p>Melville paid the following tribute to Capt. De Long in
November, during the investigation of the Jeannette expedition,
at Washington, D. C.: “Q.—Did you believe, when
you went for the log books and records left by De Long,
that the people of the first cutter were dead or alive? A.—I
was morally certain that at that time they were all dead.
Common sense and my own judgment taught me that. Before
I started, both Ninderman and Noros told me it would
be useless to look for the first cutter’s party before spring,
as beyond a possibility of doubt they were long since all
dead. At one of the reported difficulties between Mr. Collins
and Capt. De Long I believe Mr. Danenhower was
present. Mr. Collins was treated just as any other officer,
and with the same cordiality. At one time Mr. Collins
took a notion not to respond to the usual good morning
salutations of the Captain. When the Captain entered the
wash room mornings it was his custom to say, ‘Good morning,
gentlemen,’ and we all responded with ‘Good morning,
Captain.’ Mr. Collins, however, used to turn his back
when he saw the Captain coming in, and look away or walk
away without responding. Mr. Newcomb and Mr. Collins
used to talk and walk together more than they did with
any of the other officers, and were on more intimate terms
with each other than with the others. No distinction whatever
was made in the mess on account of their being civilian
officers, but all were treated the same and upon an equal
footing. I did not know that it would be deemed proper
for me to pass judgment upon my commanding officer, but,
to my mind, he was as good a man as could be assigned to
any duty at any time or in any place. He always seemed
equal to any emergency, and all that he did was done with
his whole soul. Had I supposed that I would be permitted
to speak of my commanding officer or his conduct, I should
not have allowed five minutes to pass without bearing my
testimony to his worth and unfaltering devotion to duty.
But words of mine are of little value beside the monument
which his record has erected to his heroism and unwavering
fidelity to the service and to the well-being of those intrusted
to his charge.”</p>

<p>Joseph Cook has returned to Boston, Mass., from his trip
round the world. “He refused to hold a public debate with
a noted free-thinker in Australia for the following tersely
expressed reasons: ‘<i>First.</i>—Freethought, spiritualism and
infidelity in general in America, England and India, and,
as far as I know, in Australia, are notoriously connected
with schemes for the propagation of immorality. Several
of the prominent agitators in support of infidelity and free-thought
have been sent to jail for distributing infamous
publications through the mails. No decent man can consent
to appear on the same platform with the representatives
of enterprises that have a debasing effect on the public
mind. <i>Secondly.</i>—I am not open to challenges of which
the evident object is to advertise infidelity. <i>Thirdly.</i>—Not
an unoccupied nor an unengaged hour is left open to me in
Australia. <i>Fourthly.</i>—When infidels of any kind issue a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
book that goes through ten editions in ten years, at a dollar
a copy, I will reply to it. I have a right to offer this challenge,
for several of the volumes of the ‘Boston Monday
Lectures’ have gone through ten editions in five years.

choose, into the box at my free question-box lectures.’”</p>

<p>It will be welcome news to the American people that the
revenues of the postal department are estimated to exceed
the expenditures for the coming year by over four million
dollars. This is a new and forcible argument for cheaper
postage. The President in his message recommends two
cents for letter postage, and since it would be unwise in the
government to make money out of the people through the
postal service, let us all favor a reduction in rates of postage,
and then thank President Garfield’s administration
for making it possible by beginning in earnest the good
work of overthrowing the Star Route conspirators.</p>

<p>We regret that Governor St. John, of Kansas, was not
re-elected at the recent election. He could, however, better
afford to be defeated with his record on the temperance
question, for that was the cause of it, than to be Governor
with a doubtful record on this reform. The temperance
people of these United States who are in sympathy with
Governor St. John, are more in number than the whole
population of Kansas, and the approbation of the temperance
army is a rich reward in the face of a defeat at the
hands of the rum-power.</p>

<p>Somebody sent Mrs. General James A. Beaver of Pennsylvania,
a copy of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> for November
with the lecture by Bishop Simpson on “God’s Hand in History”
marked, and wrote a note requesting her to read it,
after her husband was defeated for Governor of Pennsylvania.
She read it and was benefited. We are inclined
to believe that the doctrine of that lecture would be helpful
to the class of men who <i>were elected</i> governors at the
late elections, providing they could be persuaded to adopt
the Bishop’s theory. Success in political life is more dangerous
to the individual than defeat. More of God’s hand,
and less of man’s, in shaping the events of the history we
are making, would be better for the State and nation.</p>

<p>The New York <i>Tribune</i> says: “Thurlow Weed’s life almost
spans the history of this country under its present
Constitution. He was born before Washington died, and
when Webster, Clay, and Calhoun were making their reputations
he had edited several country newspapers and fought
in the battles of his country. He was older than Seward,
or Lincoln, or Greeley, and when Clay, Webster, and Calhoun
were dead he had not entered upon the most important
part of his career. He was alive when Napoleon’s star
appeared in the darkness of the French Revolution, and was
already a young man when the battle of Waterloo was
fought. He lived and worked with three generations of
public men. Most of the men who are now beginning to attract
attention might have been his grandsons. Benjamin
Franklin died seven years before Mr. Weed was born. The
lives of these two journalists take the world back into the
reign of Louis XIV, and beyond the birth of Frederick the
Great. Another such would very nearly reach the time of
Shakspere.”</p>

<p>President Arthur, it seems, by his last message to Congress,
has been giving special attention to the revenues of
the government. He says there is a surplus accumulating
by every tax, and gives his opinion that this is neither wise
nor economical. The surplus in the treasury for the year
ending June, 1882, was $145,000,000. This is a good point at
which Congress may begin to reduce the taxes on some
commodities.</p>

<p>The Society of “American Artists” (it is a big name) has
adopted a resolution urging Congress to remove all the
duties on foreign works of art and admit them all, superior

Suppose such wild and inconsiderate action
should be taken by Congress, it would bring pictures and
statues, made by cheap labor, from Europe by the ship
load, and work injustice to American sculptors and painters.
We need home protection for the artists quite as much
as for any class of people among us.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. J. H. Vincent writes as follows of “Webster—an
Ode:” Dr. William Cleaver Wilkinson has long
been an enthusiastic admirer of the Sage of Marshfield.
He has written two or three elaborate essays upon Webster’s
character, genius and work. This ode is a bold and brilliant
attempt to celebrate the praise of the Massachusetts
giant. Taking several salient incidents from Webster’s
life, he follows a “challenge” and “counter-challenge,”
with several short poems on the youth, education and legal
ability of the great lawyer. The ninth poem is a charming
pastoral, setting forth Webster as a farmer; the tenth celebrates
the orations on Plymouth Rock and Bunker Hill.
In the remaining poems the author exalts the statesman
and the defender of the constitution; closing with a tribute
to his stability, a plea to his state for a favorable verdict
upon the fame of her faithful son, closing the fifteenth
passage, which is a simple couplet, delicately attributing to
this song a serviceable ministration in behalf of the fame of
its subject. Forty quarto pages of the poem are followed by
eighty-two pages of elaborate, instructive, and exceedingly
valuable notes on the private morals, public virtue, genius,
statesmanship, oratory, personal traits, and religious faith
and character of Mr. Webster. There are passages of remarkable
power in this noble poem. All admirers of its
hero (and where are they not to be found), will delight in
the reading.</p>

<p>Q. Why do fogs often rise, if, as Professor Reynolds positively
and repeatedly asserts, cloud particles are all <i>descending?</i>
Is not a fog composed of cloud particles, and if so,
how can it rise if “cloud particles <i>do not float</i> but are <i>all descending
through the air?</i>”</p>

<p>A. It is a mistake to say that fogs rise. A fog is a body
of aqueous vapor in the atmosphere and is formed in several
ways. When the air is cooler than the earth the moisture
in it is partially condensed and thus rendered visible. In
this way is formed a large class of fogs and also of clouds,
the only difference between the two being in their height.
When the condensation takes place near the surface of the
earth fog is the result. Another class of fogs is formed by
the moist air radiating its heat downward to a comparatively
cold body of water, earth or air. The moist air coming into
contact with the cold body becomes greatly reduced in temperature
and after depositing a heavy dew, lies still in the
valleys over the whole surface of the ground. To this body
of cold air the atmosphere above radiates heat and when the
temperature is reduced to the dew-point the aqueous vapor
begins to condense as fog.</p>

<p>Q. Will you be kind enough to tell me in the Editor’s
Table, whether the second volume of Timayenis’ “History
of Greece” is included in any part of the course?</p>

<p>A. The list of books required for the C. L. S. C. course
will be found on page 172 of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> for Dec.</p>

<p>Q. In the November magazine you recommend Tony’s
Classical Atlas. Will you please tell us where to procure it?</p>

<p>A. A misprint in the November number made the word
Long’s read Tony’s. It should have been Long’s Classical
Atlas. It is published by Sheldon &amp; Co., New York. This
answers at least twenty similar inquiries. We are sorry
that the misprint occurred.</p>

<p>Q. What is the meaning of the terms “Platonic love,”
and “Platonic friendship”?</p>

<p>A. Spiritual love between persons of opposite sexes. The
friendship of man and woman without mixture of what is
usually called love. This affection was strongly advocated
by Plato, and hence its distinctive name.</p>

<p>Q. What is the proper pronunciation of the name of the
author of the “History of Greece,” Timayenis?</p>

<p>A. Tim-a-en´-is.</p>

<p>Q. Will <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> please tell me how to pronounce
Chautauqua?</p>

<p>A. Shaw-taw´-quaw.</p>

<p>Q. Which is the correct title to use in addressing a business
letter to a young unmarried lady, Dear Miss, or Dear
Madam?</p>

<p>A. Madam is a title used in reference to an elderly or
married woman; Miss is applied to an unmarried lady.
Therefore we would say Dear Miss in preference to Dear
Madam, or we would simply address the lady by name, as
Miss A. C. Smith, without further preliminaries.</p>

<p>Q. Of what nationality is Prof. Timayenis?</p>

<p>A. He is a Greek.</p>

<p>Q. What is the pronunciation of the words Byzantium,
geyser?</p>

<p>A. Bĭ-zan´shĭ-um. Gī´-ser.</p>

<p>Q. Is there a C. L. S. C. circle in Brooklyn?</p>

<p>A. There are several local circles in Brooklyn. F. E.
Hurst, 66 St. John’s Place, is secretary of one; F. S. Holmes,
455 Macon Street, is president of another.</p>

<p>Q. Will you please give a list of the Memorial Days for
this year?</p>

<p>A. A list of the Memorial Days will be found on page 175
of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> for December.</p>

<p>Q. What is the nature of Madame Tussaud’s famous gallery
in London, of which we see mention in writings of
travelers?</p>

<p>A. This exhibition consists of a very interesting collection
of wax figures, representing ancient and modern famous
characters. It also includes a number of memorials
of Napoleon I, his traveling carriage, captured by the Prussians
at Zenappe, and bought by Madame Tussaud for
2500<i>l</i>, and many other interesting relics. Another feature
of the exhibition is the Chamber of Horrors, containing casts
and portraits of executed criminals, the guillotine which
decapitated Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, and other
articles of the same ghastly nature.</p>

<p>Q. When did the national observance of Thanksgiving
Day begin in this country?</p>

<p>A. The occasional observance of a day of thanksgiving
commenced in New England in 1621, and the official appointment
of such a day was confined mainly to the New
England States until it became a national institution during
the Revolution. After the general thanksgiving for
peace, in 1784, there was no national appointment until
1789, when President Washington, by request of Congress,
recommended a day of thanksgiving for the adoption of the
Constitution. During the civil war President Lincoln issued
proclamations for thanksgiving in 1862, 1863 and 1864, and
since that time such a proclamation has been issued annually
by the president as well as by the governors of the
states.</p>

<p>Q. Does the C. L. S. C. contemplate helping persons who
do not attend the Chautauqua Assembly? If so, what are
the terms and conditions of membership?</p>

<p>A. Yes. For information in regard to membership consult
<span class="smcap">Chautauquan</span> for December, page 172, or address Miss
K. F. Kimball, Plainfield, N. J.</p>

<p>Q. Who is the most reliable French author of the “Life
of Napoleon Bonaparte”?</p>

<p>A. There are a great many Histories of Napoleon and
many that are reliable. We would recommend “Histoire
Napolĕon” by Elias Regnault, in four volumes, also “Histoire
du Consulat et de l’Empire,” by Louis Adolphe Thiers,
in twenty volumes.</p>

<p>Q. What is the correct pronunciation of Dana, Teutonic?</p>

<p>A. Dā´-nă. Too-ton´-ic.</p>

<p>Q. What Dictionary of the Bible would you recommend
at a cost between $2.50 to $6.00 and by whom published?
What do you think of Dr. Schaff’s?</p>

<p>A. We would recommend any work by Dr. Schaff, who
is among the first in Biblical scholarship. We would also
recommend Smith’s Bible Dictionary costing about $3.50, to
be had of any book dealer.</p>

<p>Q. Where can the Chautauqua songs be obtained?</p>

<p>A. Write Rev. J. H. Vincent, D. D.</p>

<p>Q. At what time and by whom was the Apostles’ Creed
composed, and when was it introduced into public worship?</p>

<p>A. It is said by many writers of the Roman Catholic
Church that this creed was composed by the Apostles themselves,
who agreed upon it as a rule of faith, and as a mark
of distinction by which they would know friends from foes.
According to an ancient tradition each Apostle contributed
one sentence, and a writer by the name of Augustine pretends
to tell us which article was contributed by each Apostle.
It is now generally admitted that the creed in its present
form is not of later date than the fourth century, but it
is almost impossible to ascertain its authorship. It was
first introduced into public worship in the Greek Church at
Antioch, and afterward into the Roman Church in the
eleventh century, and passed into the service of the Church
of England at the Reformation. It is used in the baptismal
confession in the Greek, Roman, English, Reformed, Lutheran,
Methodist Episcopal, and Protestant Episcopal
Churches, and no other than Apostles’ Creed is used in baptism
by any church.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_TRANSIT_OF_VENUS" id="THE_TRANSIT_OF_VENUS">THE TRANSIT OF VENUS.</a></h2>


<p>A friend in Pennsylvania writes: “Please give us a description
of the transit of Venus, in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>
for January.”</p>

<p>We answer with the following:</p>

<p>At a meeting of the New York Academy of Sciences, at
No. 12 West Thirty-first street, on the evening of December
13, Professor J. K. Rees, of Columbia College, gave the
result of his observations of the transit of Venus, made at
the college observatory. A large audience was present and
listened attentively to the lecturer’s presentation of facts.</p>

<p>“I will only detain the Academy a few moments,” said the
Professor, “in presenting the main points in the observations
made at Columbia College on December 6. Most of
the figures I will leave out. The station occupied was the
roof of the unfinished observatory of the college. The telescope
was placed in the southwest corner of the roof. This
roof is extraordinarily strong and solid, the beams being of
iron, twelve inches in depth. Solid brick arches spring from
beam to beam. The height of the roof from the street is
about one hundred and ten feet. The walls supporting the
roof are four feet thick. An unobstructed view was had of
the whole transit. The position of the instrument was only
a few feet from the old observatory, so that we may take the
longitude and latitude of our instrument from the American
ephemeris—</p>

<p>Latitude, +40° 45′ 23″.1.</p>

<p>Longitude:—From Washington, -0h. 12m. 18.40s.</p>

<p>Longitude:—From Greenwich, +4h. 55m. 53.69s.</p>

<p>“The timepieces used were a mean time chronometer,
No. 1,853, made by Parkinson &amp; Frodsham, of London,
England, and a sidereal chronometer, No. 1,564, made by
Negus &amp; Co., of New York City. The instrument used in
the observations was an equatorially mounted refractor by
Alvan Clark &amp; Sons. Aperture 5.09 inches; focal length of
object glass, 74.3 inches. The magnifying powers used
were 48 on the first contact, 165 on the second and third
contacts, and 95 on the fourth contact. The telescope was
moved by clockwork, supplied with a Bond spring governor.
In making chronometer comparisons the sidereal chronometer
was left at the college and the mean time chronometer
was carried to the instruments on which signals were to
be received. The sidereal chronometer has the hours graduated
to XII.”</p>

<p>Professor Rees had prepared, but omitted to give, an
elaborate system of chronometer comparisons with the
Western Union time signals and the Washington time signals.
The object of the comparisons was to obtain the exact
error of the chronometers used at the time of the observations.
The Western Union time signals sound the local
mean time at the City Hall of New York city. The longitude
of the City Hall from Washington is 12m. 10.47s. Mr.
Hamblet, in charge of the Western Union time system, gives
the errors of the Western Union time signals as 1.11s. fast
on December 5, noon; 1.35s. fast December 6, noon. The
professor also omitted a table of observations and the times
taken down at the instant by each of four recorders.</p>

<p>“Correcting the observed contact times,” he continued,
“the following table was obtained:</p>

<p>“The observation of the first contact was interfered with
by the clouds. Between the first contact and the second
contact the light shining through Venus’s atmosphere was
a fine sight. I should say that it first appeared to my eye
when the planet was a little more than half way on the sun,
and disappeared about a minute before the planet reached
second contact.</p>

<p>“I might, perhaps, introduce here,” said the professor,
drawing a circle upon the blackboard, “the meaning of the
terms first contact, second contact, and so on. Taking this
circle to represent the sun, Venus is a disc which is about
one-twenty-first part the diameter of the sun, and by first
contact we simply mean the instant when the disc Venus,
approaching the disc of the sun, touches it at one point externally.
The second contact occurs at the time when the
disc of Venus just touches the sun internally. The third
contact Is the instant when the disc of Venus just touches
the disc of the sun internally on one side, and the fourth
contact is the instant when it touches on the other side.</p>

<p>“The line of light,” the Professor went on, after his explanation,
“marking out the portion of Venus’ disk not on
the sun, changed its appearance considerably while my
attention was fixed upon it. I first saw a faint curved line
of light off of the sun, and apparently marking out the part
of Venus’ disk not on the sun, this curved line being entirely
disconnected from the sun. A little later this arc of light
was lengthened to a semicircular thread and touched the
edge of the sun, marking out the complete outline of the
part of Venus’ disk not on the sun. The semicircular gold
thread seemed to be an exact continuation of the dark rim
of the planet. Finally this line broadened at the point
where it touched the sun’s rim, or edge, and the summit of
the arc disappeared. The wings of light thus formed were,
at their base, not in the exact continuation of the dark outline
of the planet. I watched for the repetition of these
appearances between third and fourth contacts, but failed to
see anything. The sky between the first and second contacts
was much clearer of haze than between the third and
fourth.</p>

<p>“At second contact I saw no indication of the black drop.
The tangency of Venus’ and the sun’s discs was well seen.
During the passage of Venus over the sun’s face I observed
her disc with magnifying powers of 48, 95, 165 and 345, but
saw no indications of an atmosphere. The disc of Venus
did not appear to be uniform in blackness, but to be spotted
with grayish or whitish matter, reminding one of patches
of snow. This was seen under the different magnifying
powers used.</p>

<p>“When Venus neared the third contact a very peculiar
phenomenon was noticed. The preceding edge of Venus
was seen to be darker than the central portion. Later the
edge of the planet became of a bluish black color, and this
extended around to the following edge. The phenomena
connected with this were very distinct. When the planet
was near third contact these appearances were not seen
longer. Just before third contact a faint black drop was
observed for a short time. It disappeared very quickly, and
third contact was finely seen.</p>

<p>“The fourth contact was interfered with by the haze and
clouds, and was probably called too early.”</p>

<p>The Professor added that he desired to express his acknowledgments
for aid in the matter of timing and in
keeping the clockwork of the telescope in order to the fourth
year civil engineers of the School of Mines. Without their
assistance it would have been impossible to collect the time
data which rendered the observations of value. At the conclusion
of his address he was warmly applauded.</p>

<h2><a name="TABLE-TALK" id="TABLE-TALK">TABLE-TALK.</a></h2>


<p>Every lady who presides at a table is interested to know
how she can depend upon having things come upon the
table as she would like them. How often are remarks like
this made: “<i>This is just my fate;</i> when I really want a nice
thing, <i>somehow or other it turns out poor!</i>”</p>

<p>A lady expects company for tea. She orders, for instance,
biscuits, and they are brought to the table heavy and indigestible.
How many housekeepers can testify to mortification,
as well as disappointment, under such circumstances!
It may not, however, have occurred to them that
it is not always the “cook’s fault.” Your biscuits, cakes,
pot-pies, puddings, etc., etc., can not be raised with earth
or any worthless substances, and it becomes your own fault
when you permit any baking powder to come into your
kitchen about which you know absolutely nothing as to its
purity or healthfulness.</p>

<p>The market is flooded with “low-priced” baking powders,
gotten up to make an unjust profit by unscrupulous manufacturers
and dealers, and it is worthy the attention of all
housekeepers to note there is at least one brand of baking
powder distinctly sold upon its merits, and which can be
relied upon for its strength and purity. The Royal Baking
Powder, now known almost the world over as a standard
article, has stood the test of nearly a quarter of a century,
and its friends among the ladies are legion.</p>

<h3>THE BEGINNINGS OF HISTORY,</h3>

<div class="hang1">

According to the Bible and the Traditions of
Oriental Peoples. From the Creation of Man
to the Deluge. By <span class="smcap">Francois Lenormant</span>,
Professor of Archæology at the National Library
of France, etc., etc. (Translated
from the Second French Edition). With
an introduction by <span class="smcap">Francis Brown</span>, Associate
Professor in Biblical Philology, Union
Theological Seminary. 1 vol. 12mo, 640 pp.,
$2 50.</div>

<p>“The work is one which deserves to be studied by all
students of ancient history, and in particular by ministers
of the Gospel, whose office requires them to interpret
the Scriptures, and who ought not to be ignorant of the
latest and most interesting contributions of science to the
elucidation of the sacred volume.”—<i>The Tribune.</i></p>


<hr class='short' />


<h3>COREA, THE HERMIT NATION.</h3>

<div class="hang1">

By <span class="smcap">William Elliot Griffis</span>, author of “The
Mikado’s Empire,” and late of the Imperial
University of Tokio, Japan. 1 vol.,
8vo, with numerous maps and illustrations,
$3 50.</div>

<p>“The work bears witness to a vast amount of well-directed
labor, and, while it is clothed with a rare charm
for the general reader, whose curiosity regarding a long
isolated nation will for the first time be satisfied, it is also
sure of a respectful and grateful reception from the student
of history, ethnology and philology.”—<i>New York
Sun.</i></p>

<hr class='short' />



<h3>THE HOUSE BEAUTIFUL.</h3>

<div class="hang1">

Essays on Beds and Tables, Stools and Candlesticks.
By <span class="smcap">Clarence Cook</span>. With over
100 illustrations from original drawings.
1 vol., small 4to, cloth, extra. Price reduced
to $4 00.</div>

<p>“Mr. Cook writes with an easy finish, and much daintiness
of touch, and his pages have a very fresh and pleasant
flavor. The publishers have so manufactured the
work that it might be called ‘The Book Beautiful.’ But
the charm in it lies deeper than in paper surface and
letter-press and graver’s lines; and wherever it goes it will
educate, inspire and refine.”—<i>The Literary World.</i></p>


<hr class='short' />


<h3>Woman’s Handiwork in Modern Homes.</h3>

<div class="hang1">

By <span class="smcap">Constance Cary Harrison</span>. One vol.,
8vo, richly bound in illuminated cloth, with
numerous illustrations and five colored
plates from designs by Samuel Colman, Rosina
Emmet, George Gibson, and others.
Price, $2 00.</div>

<p>Mrs. Harrison’s book combines with a discussion of
the principles of design and decoration, practical chapters
on embroidery, painting on silk and china, etc.,
most helpful hints as to the domestic manufacture of
many objects of use and beauty in house-furnishing, and
also suggestions for the arrangement and decoration of
rooms in the details of screens, portieres, the mantelpiece,
etc.</p>

Being Travels through Egypt, Arabia, and
Persia, to Bagdad. By <span class="smcap">William Perry
Fogg</span>. With an introduction by <span class="smcap">Bayard
Taylor</span>. A new edition, with nearly 100
illustrations. 1 vol., 8vo, $2 00.</div>

<p>“There are no long, dry discussions of scientific or
antiquarian problems, but a lively and engaging picture
of lands and people, which we in this country know
little of, is presented by a man of quick, intelligent observation,
with a genial but not obtrusive fund of humor,
who evidently thoroughly enjoyed every hour of his
journeyings.”—<i>Chicago Times.</i></p>

<h3>SWINTON’S ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.</h3>

<div class="hang1">
A Critical History of Operations in Virginia,

1861-65, by <span class="smcap">William Swinton</span>. A new and
revised edition, with additions. With steel
plate portraits and maps. 1 vol., 8vo, $3 00.</div>

<p>“The reputation of Mr. Swinton’s ‘Army of the Potomac’
is so well established, that we need do no more than
to say here, once for all, that it is a work well-nigh indispensable
to the student of the war. * * For all
that large class who have grown up since the war was
over, this new edition will be invaluable. The book is,
and always will be, a standard work.”—<i>The Nation.</i></p>

<h3>POEMS OF AMERICAN PATRIOTISM.</h3>

<div class="hang1">

Chosen by <span class="smcap">J. Brander Matthews</span>. 1 vol.,
12mo, $1 50.</div>

<p>“An every way beautiful book, containing fifty-six of
our best national poems. * * Taken as a whole,
we doubt whether the poetic literature of England would
yield a richer collection of purely patriotic poetry than
this.”—<i>The Mail and Express.</i></p>


<hr class='short' />


<h3>EAST OF THE JORDAN.</h3>

<div class="hang1">

A Record of Travel and Observation in the

Archæologist of the American Palestine
Exploration Society. With illustrations
and a map. 1 vol., 8vo, $4 00.</div>

<p>“Dr. Merrill stands in the front rank of American archæologists.
There is in America no better authority
than he on all questions connected with the ancient life
of the East, and his contribution to our knowledge of the
Holy Land will take its place in the professional library
alongside of ‘Robinson’s Researches.’”—<i>The Christian
Union.</i></p>

College. With an appendix giving valuable
directions for courses of reading, prepared
by <span class="smcap">James M. Hubbard</span>, late of the
Boston Public Library. 1 vol., crown 8vo, $2.</div>

<p>“President Noah Porter’s ‘Books and Reading’ is by
far the most practical and satisfactory treatise on the subject
that has been published. It not only answers the
questions ‘What books shall I read?’ and ‘How shall I
read them?’ but it supplies a large and well-arranged catalogue
under appropriate heads, sufficient for a large
family or a small public library.”—<i>Boston Zion’s Herald.</i></p>

<h3>THE BOOK OF FORTY PUDDINGS.</h3>

<div class="hang1">

By <span class="smcap">Susan Anna Brown</span>. 1 vol, with attractive
and appropriate binding, 50 cents.</div>

<p>“‘The Book of Forty Puddings’ tells of puddings,
nothing more or less, but they are the best of puddings
for epicures. Very cunningly the appetite is whetted
before reading the papers, by covers tinted and designed
in perfect taste.”—<i>Boston Globe.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Lanier’s books, which made him the companion

the ballads in their purest and strongest form, from
